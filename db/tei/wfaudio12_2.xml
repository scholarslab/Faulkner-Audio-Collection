						Uncle Buck and said, "Well? Did you help them threes?"<lb/>
						"No," Uncle Buck said.<lb/>
						"Well I did," Mr Hubert said. He shot his hand across the table so the

						Uncle Buck was watching them, but if he was, he never showed himself, never
						came out of the woods. So Miss Sophonsiba was nowhere in sight either, so at
						least Uncle Buck didn't give—hadn't quite given up; at least he hadn't asked her yet.
						And he and Uncle Buddy and Mr Hubert ate supper and they came in from the
						kitchen and cleared the table, leaving only the lamp on it and the deck of
						cards. Then it was just like last night, except that Uncle Buddy had no
						necktie and Mr Hubert wore the clothes now instead of a nightshirt and it
						was a shaded lamp on the table instead of a candle, and Mr Hubert sitting at
						his end of the table with the deck in his hands, riffling the edges with his
						thumb and looking at Uncle Buddy. Then he tapped the edges even and set the
						deck out in the middle of the table under the lamp, and folded his arms on
						the edge of the table and leaned forward a little on the table, looking at
						Uncle Buddy, who was sitting at his end of the table with his hands in his
						lap, all one gray color, like an old gray rock or a stump with gray moss on
						it, that still, with his round white head like Uncle Buck's but he didn't
						blink like Uncle Buck and he was a little thicker than Uncle Buck, as if
						from sitting down so much watching food cook, as if the things he cooked had
						made him a little thicker than he would have been and the things he cooked
						with, and the flour and such, had made him all one same quiet color.

								"Hah," Mr Hubert said. "It's said that a

						folded his arms back onto the table-edge. "Deal," he said. Still neither he
						nor Uncle Buddy looked up. They just sat there while—while Tomey's Turl's

						years I wont have on my place. We will be right back where all this

						either got to give a nigger away, or risk buying one that you done already
						admitted you cant keep at home." Then he stopped talking. For about a minute
						it was like he and Uncle Buddy had both gone to sleep. Then Mr Hubert picked
						up his face-down card and turned it over. It was another three, and Mr
						Hubert sat there without looking at anything at all, his fingers beating a
						tattoo, slow and steady and not very loud, on the table. "H'm," he said.
						"And you need a trey and there aint but four of them and I already got
						three. And you just shuffled. And I cut afterward. And if I call you, I will
						have to buy that nigger. Who dealt these cards, Amodeus?" Only he didn't
						wait to be answered. He reached out and tilted the lamp-shade, the light
						moving up Tomey's Turl's arms that were supposed to be black but were not
						quite white, up his Sunday shirt that was supposed to be white but wasn't
						quite either, that he put on every time he ran away just as Uncle Buck put
						on the necktie each time he went to bring him back, and on to his face; and
						Mr Hubert sat there, holding the lampshade and looking at Tomey's Turl. Then
						he tilted the shade back down and took up his cards and turned them
						face-down and pushed them across the middle of the table. "I pass, Amodeus,"

						started and the fox never even got out of the crate, because the dogs were
						right there in the room. Old Moses went right into the crate with the fox,
						so that both of them went right—right on out through the back end of it. That is,
						the fox went through, because when Uncle Buddy opened the door to come in,
						old Moses was still wearing most of the crate around his neck until Uncle
						Buddy kicked it off him. So they made just one run, across the front

					<head>Trip to Greece</head>
					<u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
				<u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, this is a little bit off the theme of literature, but I'd
					like to—if you wouldn't mind tell us a little about your trip to Greece? <unclear>I think</unclear> I would
					like to hear a little about that, if that's not getting too far off the subject,
					too far away from it.</u>
				<u who="WF">It was a—a strange experience in that that was the only country that
					looked exactly like—we had—I mean, the—the background, the—the educational
					background of—of the Anglo-Saxon had taught him to expect it to look. And sure
					enough, there was the Hellenic light that I had heard of, had read about. And I
					saw Homer's wine-dark sea, too. And there was a—the only place I was in where
					there was a sense of a very distant past, but there was nothing inimical in it.
					In the other parts of—of the Old World there's a sense of—of the past, but
					there is something—something <unclear>Gothic</unclear>—Gothic and in a sense 
					a little terrifying. In Greece, the people seem to function against that past
					that for all its—its remoteness in time, it was—was still inherent in
					the—the—the light, the resurgence of spring. You didn't expect to see the—the
					ghost of—of the old Greeks, or expect to see the actual figures of the gods, but
					you had a sense that they—they were near, and they were still powerful, not
					inimical, just—just powerful. That they themselves had—had reached and were
					enjoying a—a kind of a nirvana. They existed, but they were free of—of man's
					folly and trouble, of having to involve themselves in man's problem. That they
					were—at last had the time to watch what man did without having to be involved in
					it. Yes, it was—was very interesting. I—I think that—that two weeks is not only
					too short, it's an insult to that country, that one should go with—with no limit
					to his visit. That there's no end to what you can see, and then sure enough, you
					see something which is exactly like what you imagined. There will be the plain
					and—and across it, suddenly there is Parnassus with snow on it, and the old
					ruins—they look ancient, but there's a sense as though it happened only
					yesterday. That whether Agamemnon ever lived, ever was an actual man or not,
					there he was, he—because he had to be. It was necessary. That he—he was in the
					literary history of man's spirit, so therefore he must have existed at one time
					as a flesh and blood man.

				<u who="WF">He had never heard of respectability. He didn't even know it existed,
					until suddenly <event desc="audience laughter"/> he found that he needed it. And
					so he assumed it, and as soon as he doesn't need respectability any longer, he
					will cast it away. That he had a certain aim which he intended to attain. He
					would use whatever tools necessary, with complete ruthlessness, to gain that
					end. And if he had to use respectability, he would use that. If he had to use
					religious observance, he would use that. If he has to destroy his wife, he will
					do that. If he has to—to trick a—a—a child, a girl child, into—to being his
					tool, he will do that with no compunction whatever. That respectability to him

				<u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
				<u who="Q">May I ask <unclear>you</unclear>, to what extent when you're composing your stories, are your
					characters— do they represent ideas or a theme consciously on your part, or to
					what extent are they just people who keep developing as characters and let 
					theme and plot fall where they may?</u>
				<u who="WF">Yes, the character comes first as people. I—I didn't have enough formal
					education to—to know really what ideas are, that ideas to me must be translated
					into—to the human being struggling against his own problems. The ideas are only
					incidental or maybe coincidental to writing about people, and the—the ideas of
					the—the symbolism, they are simply, in my own case, the tools which the
					craftsman uses to tell the story, but his interest is primarily in the
					characters, not in the plot, not really so much in what they do, but it's in—in
					making the—the—the figure of his imagination assume three dimensions and stand
					on its own feet and cast its own shadow. The symbolism, the style, the ideas are
					only coincidental to that and are simply the tools which the craftsman
					uses.</u>
					<u who="Q">But would—would you say then, sir,
					that you have to—you would begin with an idea for a character rather than an
					anecdote or an idea?</u>
				<u who="WF">Well—</u>
				<u who="Q">Of an event?</u>
				<u who="WF">It could be an anecdote or a scene, but it would be not an idea. It
					would be people in motion, people in some tragic or comic situation struggling
					to get out of it, or it could be—come—the first conception would be the character
					itself.</u></div2>

					<head>Germ of "Was"</head>
					<u who="Q">For example, this story you read
					us this evening, do you recall—this is probably so far back, I wondered, though,
					what was the germ of that story? Do you recall it, perhaps?</u>
				<u who="WF">The germ of the story was one of the three oldest ideas that—that man
					can write about, which is—is love, sex. And to me it was—was comic, of the man
					that had got himself involved in an engagement, and he himself couldn't
					extricate himself, and his— <event desc="audience laughter"/> he had to call on
					his brother, and his brother used the only tools he had, which was his ability
					to play poker. <event desc="audience laughter"/> Which to me what was funny. It
					was funny. Also, it was—it had a certain sociological importance in, to show my
					country as it really was in those days. The—the—the elegance of the colonial
					plantation didn't exist in my country. My country was still frontier. The
					plantation, the—the—the columned porticos, that was Charleston and Natchez. But
					in my country it was still frontier. People lived from day to day, with a—with a
					bluff and crude hardiness, but with a—a certain simplicity, which to me is very
					interesting because the—the common picture of the South is all magnolias and
					crinoline and—and Grecian portals and things like that, which was true only
					around the fringes of the South, not in the interior, the backwoods.

					<head>Using Experience</head>
					<u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
				<u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, to what extent have you drawn directly on experience for
					these stories?</u>
				<u who="WF">That's difficult to say. The writer, I think, has three reservoirs: one
					is experience, which includes what he has read. The other is observation, which,
					of course, is what he has seen and done. The third is imagination.  And he
					himself doesn't know, and, in fact, he hasn't gotten time to be concerned or to
					care how much of which he draws on at any one time. It's as though he had three
					reservoirs with three pipes that go to a common tap, with maybe a—an automatic
					selector somewhere that—that when—when observation doesn't go far enough, it
					tries experience. When experience hasn't gone far enough, it reverts to
					imagination, that the only check is some rigid concept of what is truth and what
					is not truth in—in the craftsman, which what he does has got to match. If it
					doesn't match, he throws it away, and then he's got to—to go back to
					imagination. If that is not enough, then he's got to—to increase his experience
					or his observation. But no man can say just how much of—of each he uses. He
					knows, any writer, that he is going to change and alter anything he writes
					because any fiction writer is a congenital liar to begin with, you see. He is
					not going to—to take anything as is. He's going to change it.

					<head>Decision to Write</head>
					<u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
				<u who="Q">Sir, is there any one incident in your life that you just decided then
					that you were going to become a writer?</u>
				<u who="WF">I was living in New Orleans. I was running a—a power boat for a
					bootlegger. I would go down <event desc="audience laughter"/> and take the boat
					with a—a—a man with a gun and a—a—a—Negro hand for the crew through the industrial
					canal across the—the Mississippi Sound to an island where the schooner would
					bring the raw alcohol up from the Indies, and we would load the cargo and bring
					it back to town. I'd get a hundred dollars for each trip, and in those days,
					that was a lot of money, so I wouldn't have to work until I began to run out of
					money. Then I would make another run with the boat, and I met Sherwood Anderson,
					and I liked him at once. We would meet and walk around the French Quarter, and
					he would talk, and I would listen. We would meet again in the evening. We'd go
					to some pleasant courtyard, and we'd sit over a bottle of whiskey, and he would
					talk, and I would listen. In the mornings, he would be in seclusion working.
					That went on day after day, and I thought if—if that's all you had to do to be a
					writer, then that was the life for me, <event desc="audience laughter"/> so I
						<unclear>decided I wanted to</unclear> become a writer, and I started a
					book, and right away I found it was fun to do, and I hadn't seen Mr. Anderson in
					weeks. I met Mrs. Anderson on the street, and she said, "We haven't seen you." I
					said, "Yes'm, I'm writing a book." She said, "Good God." <event desc="audience laughter"/> I saw her again a few weeks later. She said, "I
					told Anderson—Sherwood you were writing a book. She says, "Do I want him,
						Mr. Anderson, to read it?'" I said, "Well'm, he can if he
					wants to." She said, "Well, he told me to tell you he'll make a trade with you.
					If he don't have to read that manuscript, he'll tell his publisher to take it."
					So I said, "done." <event desc="audience laughter"/> And I finished the
					manuscript, and he told his publisher to take it, and that's how I got to be a
					professional writer. <event desc="audience laughter"/> But, of course, by that
					time, I'd found that writing was fun. It was—was—was the most fun I'd found yet,
					and I knew then that I had been bitten and was incurable.

					always try to remind myself to stop before I'm—have found out I'm tired, but as
					long as it's hot, it's—it's difficult to break off and—and quit. That takes a
					certain amount of discipline, to stop and always leave something fresh to start
					on tomorrow. That's the only rule about writing I have, is never to write
					completely out at one stretch. That could be an hour or sixteen hours in a day,
					though there're some workmen that—that have to have a rigid discipline. They sit
					so many hours a day whether they write anything or not. They do research. They
					have notebooks, and they—they take a piece of paper and—and plot a graph for
					the story to follow, which I've never done, because I'm lazy, and I—I don't like
					the effort of putting the words on the paper, so I put that on—put that off as

				<u who="Q">I have a question I've always wanted to ask an author, is do they really
					put all the significance and meaning and trying to teach this big lesson in the
					book, and I—I had thought that you answered it once, but then you seem to
					contradict yourself. Do you write to try to teach somebody a lesson, to describe
					your state, or just because you think you've got to write a good story and make
					some money off of it?</u>
				<u who="WF">No, no. All that is incidental. What the writer is—is—is doing is trying
					to create people. He hasn't got time to bother with the symbols and the message.
					The first-rate writer hasn't. He is busy creating people, and he would do that
					even if he had to pay for the privilege. He's not interested in the money. The
					money is—is incidental, too, that he is having a—a good time creating living
					people.</u>
				<u who="Q">And that's motive enough <unclear>to write a book</unclear>?</u>
				<u who="WF">Uh, yes, I think so. Actually, he's—he's demon-driven. The—the writer
					who is trying to—to tell a message is not primarily a writer. He is—he's more of 
					an—an evangelist or a propagandist <unclear>maybe</unclear>.

				<u who="WF">No, no. No writer is satisfied with—with the folks that God creates.
					He's convinced that he can do much better than that. <event desc="audience laughter"/> To me, Ike Snopes was simply an interesting human
					being with—with man's natural, normal failings, his—the baseness which man
					fights against, the—the honor which he hopes that he can always match. The
					honesty, the courage which he hopes that he can always match. And at times he
					fails. And then he is—he is pitiable. But he's still human, and he still
					believes that man can be better than he is, and that is what the writer is—is
					trying to do, is interested in, to—to show man as he is in conflict with his
					problems, with his nature, with his own heart, with his fellows, and with his
					environment. That's all I—in my opinion, any book or story is about. Of course it

				<u who="WF">That was an unfortunate remark I made about twenty years ago that I've
					been explaining ever since.  It was at a—a
					group meeting something like this. Someone asked me how I rated my
					contemporaries. I said it's too soon to rate us, we haven't finished yet. He
					said, "Well, you have—haven't you any opinion at all about them?" I said, "About
					who?" He named Wolfe, Dos Passos, Caldwell, and Hemingway. I said, "Well," and
					this was sort of off the cuff. I never thought of it before. I said, "Well, I—I
					think we all failed, and so I would rate them on the—the splendor of the
					failure." I put Wolfe first because he made the—the—the most splendid failure. I
					put myself second. I put Dos Passos third, Caldwell fourth and Hemingway fifth.
					It had nothing to do with the value of the work we'd done but on the—on the
					splendor with which we had failed. I put Hemingway last because he had found
					quickly a—a method in which he was secure, and he didn't need to splash around,
					to experiment, that he stuck to that, and he didn't—didn't need to—to try to—to
					put all the history of man's heart onto one pinhead and one paragraph, which
					Wolfe had tried to do, which is why Wolfe's material would have been unreadable
					had it not been for his editor, Mr. Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, and Mr.
					Perkins in—in a way really wrote Wolfe's book because the mass of incoherent

					that enter when you wrote that, or—</u>
				<u who="WF">Well, it would depend on what he is symbolic of. You see people who are
					inhuman people. I think that I didn't invent an inhuman—the inhuman type, which—
					which Flem is a—a manifestation of. I think that Jason Compson in another book
					of mine is—is completely inhuman. But in a way, he is, I hope, a living man. I
					have known people in actual life who were hopeless, who in—in the terms of—of—of
					the humanities, in the terms of—of the—of the verities of—of man's condition,
					compassion and pity and courage, unselfishness—he was inhuman, but he was still
					a living man. He was not created to be a symbol of anything. He was simply
					created because suddenly he had a place in—in that particular scene that I was
					writing about, in that particular problem of human beings that I was writing
					about. Not to symbolize anything at all.
