                            a novel called <hi rend="italic">The Sound and the Fury</hi>
                            <unclear>with</unclear> Quentin Compson wanting to love people and the same sort

                            Quentin and Holden were very much alike except in being a little too sensitive
                            and coming from a somewhat similar background of—of people that
                            were—were over-intelligent but incapable of—of any strength
                            of—of mutual affection and tenderness, which, as I got it,
                            was—was Holden's home.</u>
                        <u who="AKD">Mr. Faulkner, Holden wasn't grown up, and Quentin was grown up. He was
                            holding onto something. <inaudible/> He was a case of arrested
                            development, and Holden was a case of <inaudible/>. Isn't that true?</u>
                        <u who="WF">Yes, sir, there was that difference.</u>

                            an ideal, wasn't he, sir?</u>

                        <u who="AKD">That—that simply could not be lived up to in his terms.</u>
                        <u who="WF">Yes, that's right. That couldn't have been lived up to in any time
                            maybe. But Holden Caulfield was simply looking for something which should be
                            everybody's right, not only a privilege, but everybody's right, to find mankind
                            and—and love mankind and be accepted into mankind, and he couldn't,
                            because mankind, as I tried to say in my paper, in Holden's terms, wasn't there anymore.</u>
