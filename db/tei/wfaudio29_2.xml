                    chance ever to—to accept love or return love because she was incapable

                    because she was going to be chatelaine of a plantation. And then she found he was
                    going to give all that away, and the only revenge she knew was deny—to
                    deny him sexually, that was the only triumph she had. And she was going to make
                    him suffer for that just as much as she could to get even with him.</u>
                <u who="Q">So she intended from the beginning of her marriage to deny him this one
                    thing that he had requested until it was useful in blackmailing—?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, she assumed when they got married that she was going to be
                    chatelaine of a plantation, and they would have children. And she was going to
                    be as—according to the rules of the book—a good wife to him.
                    She'd still be frigid and cold and a shrew probably, but she'd be a good wife.
                    Then when he was going to throw the plantation away for idealistic folly, all
                    she—the only revenge she had was that. At least he would have no

                    home for him, do you think that his—that he would have ever
                    compromised with his ideals? After all, he had no training, no way of providing
                    for her.</u>
                <u who="WF">I would say, since we are supposing, if she had been that sort of woman,
                    she would have understood his—his hatred of that condition. She might
                    have been practical enough to say, "This is the way we'll do it. We can't
                    abandon these people. But let's do it this way." And he would have said, "You're
                    wiser than I. Let's try it your way." That's possible. I would like to think
                    that. But he would have stuck to his—his position that "I will not
                    profit from this which is—is wrong and sinful."

                <u who="Q">Sir, one of the most interesting aspects of "The Bear," to me, is the
                    conflict between man and the wilderness. I would like to ask you if you intend for
                    the reader to sympathize more with Old Ben and his conflict with hunters or with
                    the hunters and their conflict with Old Ben?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, not sympathize. I—I doubt if—if
                    the—the writer is asking anyone to sympathize, to choose sides. That
                    is the reader's right. What the writer is asking is compassion, understanding
                    that—that change must alter, must happen, and change is going to alter
                    what was. That no matter how fine anything seems, it can't endure because
                    it—once it stops—abandons motion, it is dead. It's to have
                    compassion for the—for the anguish that—that the wilderness
                    itself may have felt by being ruthlessly destroyed by axes, by—by men
                    who simply wanted to—to make that earth grow something that
                        they could sell for a profit, which brought into it a
                    condition based on an evil like human bondage. It's not to—to choose
                    sides at all, just to compassionate the—the—the good,
                    splendid things which change must destroy, the splendid, fine things which are a
                    part of man's past, too, part of man's heritage, too. But they were obsolete and
                    had to go. But that's no need to—to not feel compassion for
                    them, simply because they were obsolete.

                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, is that what you meant by the ending of this, then, that
                    change must destroy all goodness?</u>
                <u who="WF">Change, if it is not controlled by wise people, destroys sometimes more
                    than it—it brings. That—unless some
                    wise person comes along in—in the—in the middle of the
                    change and takes charge of it, change can destroy what is irreplaceable. If the
                    reason for the change is—is base in motive. That is, to—to
                    clear the wilderness just to make cotton land, to raise cotton on a—on
                    an agrarian economy of—of peonage, slavery, is—is base
                    because it's not as good as that wilderness which it replaced. But if in the end
                    that makes more education for more people and more food for more people, more of
                    the—the good things of life—I mean by that to give man
                    leisure to—to use what's up here, instead of just leisure to ride
                    around in automobiles, then the—it was worth destroying the
                    wilderness. But if all—if all the destruction of the wilderness does
                    is to give more people more automobiles just to ride around in, then the
                    wilderness was better.

                    Ike or some of the older hunters?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, yes, Boon had his size, his physical size and strength. He had the
                    mentality of a child, and he wouldn't stop to think, "This may be a little
                    dangerous to run in there." He had the—the capacity to—to
                    love that dog, enough to—to risk being mauled to save that dog's life.
                    That Boon with his unreliability, his lack of—of intellect, had
                    God-like attributes if he ever met the opportunity to show. And he met,
                    probably, his great moment in life, when he could use his strength
                    and—and his capacity to be—be brave, to—to save,
                    to protect the weak from the strong, even though the weak was just a dog. Also,
                    Boon was a descendant of the same Indian clan that Sam Fathers was descended
                    from. Sam Fathers, whether Boon knew it or not, was descended from the chief. He
                    was Boon's superior in the <unclear>woods</unclear> because he had better blood.
                    Boon was—Boon's Chickasaw ancestor was probably just a
                        <unclear>hunter</unclear>. Sam's, even though his mother was a Negro, his
                    father was a chief, a king. And maybe Boon was doing what he knew Sam expected
                    him to do.

                        to lead a</unclear> very Christ-like existence, and he becomes a carpenter,
                    and was that not intentional?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, not deliberately intentional. I mean this, the—the
                    symbolism, is—is literary. It's a part of—of anyone's past,
                    background. So these symbols will appear, just as the way you—you
                    pronounce your words appear. You don't know where you learned to pronounce words
                    the way you do because you—you inherited that or it came from your
                    early environment, and these symbols, which are Christian symbols, are a part of
                    the—the Christian background which all of us in this country came
                    from. That's why I think critics read into books what the writer didn't know was
                    there, because he reads from the same background of Christian symbolism which
                    the writer unconsciously <unclear>wrote</unclear> from. And I'm sure that these
                    symbols are all there, but the writer himself don't know it till somebody points
                    them out to him. Because he is too busy simply telling about people to have to
                    hunt around to—to use symbols to tell about people with. The symbols
                    insert themselves just as the proper word does. Because that is a part of his
                    culture, part of his literary background.

                    there's—there's—bravery is like—like the water in
                    the earth. It—it don't diminish. It might alter. Some it's clouds.

                    knows whether he will be able to be brave enough. Quite often he is to his

                    they are brave, that they may do dangerous things, just as you take a drink. It
                    makes you feel good to know that you are brave. Some people are content

                    want to look good, so you're brave. You might be scared to death, but for the
                    moment you're brave because you want to look good to your—to your
