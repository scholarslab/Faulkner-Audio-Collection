== Faulkner Audio Collection Experiment

This application is an experiment in developing a lightweight web application to deliver library-managed TEI encoded documents. The collection is based upon the tape recordings of talks William Faulkner gave at the University of Virginia during his tenure as "writer-in-residence" from 1957 - 1958.
