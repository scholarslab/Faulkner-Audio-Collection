                    <head>Show 1 Introduction</head>
                    <u who="ES">Today we are very fortunate to have as our special guest Mr. William
                    Faulkner of Oxford, Mississippi, the celebrated—justly celebrated
                    Southern writer of fiction and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949.
                    Our panel is somewhat larger than usual today, as several of the students from
                    my English 32 class have joined us. In addition to Mr. Robert Kellogg of the
                    Department of English, one of our regular panel members, we have with us
                    also today Mr. Houk, Mrs. Massey, Miss Winslow, Miss Taylor, Miss Marston, Mr.
                    Bagley, Mr. Nesbit, Mr. Miller, Mr. Carlson and Miss Frame of
                    the class in the history of the English language who are here to ask Mr.
                    Faulkner some questions about his use of dialect and other questions concerning
                    language in his fiction writing. And I suppose without further ado we might as
                    well start on the questions. <lb/>
                        Mr. Houk, will you lead off with the first question, please?   
                    </u></div2>

                    <head>Doom's Name</head>
                <u who="H">Yes. Mr. Faulkner, your character Doom has the—a curious
                    history for his name. His Indian name Ikkemotubbe was translated  
                    <hi rend="italic">L'homme</hi> or <hi rend="italic">De l'homme</hi> in French,
                    then was translated by him back to Doom in English. I understand that's
                    correct.</u>
                <u who="WF">That's correct. It was translated back to Doom not by him but by his
                    associates trying to pronounce his French name, given to him by the French
                    adventurer who called himself the Chevalier Soeur-Blonde de Vitry, that he met
                    in New Orleans. That was simply an anglicization of the French <hi rend="italic">De l'homme</hi>.</u>
                <u who="H">And that Anglicization would be your imagination—from your
                    imagination rather than from facts. In other words, you do not know a parallel
                    such as this one in Indian lore.</u>
                <u who="WF">No, I would certainly like to think I invented that.</u></div2>

                    <head>Use of Aint</head>
                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, I'd like to ask you about your use of "aint" in the
                    dialogue of your characters. In particular, in <hi rend="italic">As I Lay
                        Dying.</hi> When Anse Bundren is talking to Vernon Tull he says, "I aint
                    asking it of you, he says, I can always do it for me and mine. I aint asking you to
                    risk your mule. It aint your dead; I am not blaming you." Now why do you have
                    the switch between—from "aint" to "am not"?</u>
                <u who="WF">"Am not" is more positive.</u>
                <u who="Q">So you use the "am not" when you are definite <inaudible/>—</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes, to be very positive, yes. Otherwise they would have said
                    "aint."</u></div2>

                    <head>Title Light in August</head>
                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, in <hi rend="italic">The Portable Faulkner</hi> the editor
                    says, "Incidentally the title of the novel has nothing to do with August
                    sunlight; it refers to Lena Grove and her baby. In the Mississippi backwoods, it
                    is sometimes said of a pregnant woman, but more often of a mare or cow, that she
                    will be light in August or September." Is this how you meant it to
                    be—the title?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, I never heard of that. It refers to a texture of the light in August
                    in my country, in a spell of two or three cool days we call "blackberry winter."
                    It's the light. I had never heard that business of after the cow drops the calf
                    she's light in August.</u>
                <u who="ES">And that—you don't know that expression at all.</u>
                <u who="WF">No.</u>
                <u who="ES">I haven't heard it in Georgia either.</u>
                <u who="Q">I suppose people have spoken to you of it since then?</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes.</u></div2>

                    <head>Character Names</head>
                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, in connection with this class in particular, we've been
                    very interested in reading about names in America, about personal and
                    geographical names. I wonder to what extent the names that you use parallel
                    those that have actually occurred in your lifetime, or in any history that you
                    may have learned.</u>
                <u who="WF">I think any writer is very careful always not to use actual names if he
                    can help it because a great deal of his time would be taken up explaining to the
                    actual owner of that name that he didn't refer to him, was not impugning his
                    character nor his past nor his parentage.</u>
                    <u who="ES">Originally in "The Spotted Horses" story, weren't you going to call the
                    sewing machine salesman Suratt, and then you met somebody by that name so you
                    changed the name to Ratliff, <unclear>didn't you</unclear>?</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes, that's right.</u></div2>

                    <head>Sartoris' Dialect</head>
                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, does the speech of Sartoris in the story "Ad Astra" have
                    any special dialect qualities? Is it a southern speech, or is it just the speech
                    of an average educated American?</u>
                <u who="WF">It would be the speech of a limited young man, who had no particular
                    education. It was a speech he had heard from his associates back on his
                    Mississippi plantation, colored just a little by what he had listened to serving
                    with English troops probably.</u></div2>
                <div2 type="dialog" id="wfaudio27.8" start="00:06:32.90" end="00:07:15.79">
                    <head>Lief</head>
                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, Ek Snopes uses the archaic word "<unclear>lief</unclear>"
                    in "I'd just as lief let them stay out there." Is this word still common in
                    Mississippi?</u>
                <u who="WF">Oh yes, there are any number of words derived from lowland Scottish in
                    Mississippi country people's talk. They say "to ret up a room."</u>
                <u who="ES">That <unclear>leif</unclear>—it may be just my own
                    inexperience, but I haven't come across that in Georgia. I wonder—it
                    may be a difference between the speech of Georgia—popular speech, folk
                    speech in Georgia and in Mississippi. I remember being struck by that too,
                    because I wasn't familiar with it in Georgia speech.</u></div2>

                    <head>Dialect and Characterization</head>
                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, to what degree do you consider dialect in speech important
                    in characterization?</u>
                <u who="WF">I think you can't draw a character simply by putting dialect into his
                    mouth. It is important as a part of the picture of the man, an indigenous
                    picture of the individual. In that sense it's important, that is a man will
                    speak according to his nature, his degree and his geography.</u></div2>
                <div2 type="dialog" id="wfaudio27.10" start="00:07:49.36" end="00:09:03.38">
                    <head>Ourn and Hisn</head>
                    <u who="ES">Here's an example, Mr. Faulkner, that might have a bearing on that. In
                    the story "Barn Burning," the little boy, Sarty Snopes, uses the forms, the
                    grammatical forms, "ourn" and "hisn." What do these tell the reader about the
                    speaker, would you say?</u>
                <u who="WF">That he came from an uneducated class of white people.</u>
                <u who="ES">Those terms are in use in the southern mountains more than in the
                    lowlands, I think, in the South, more than in the coastal plains of the South.
                    Is there any implication that these people are from mountain extraction or
                    anything of that sort?</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes, they're people whose dialect has not been colored at all by the
                    talk of—of Negroes. They are mountain people, where there are not many
                    Negroes. Their speech is harsher. The "r" is more definite than the "r" in the
                    white child that has lived with Negroes.</u>
                <u who="ES">Yes. Of course that's an old controversy, whether the Negroes learned
                    their speech from the white people, or whether the white people were influenced
                    by the Negroes. I guess we'd better not get into that—it's too
                    complicated a question.</u></div2>

                    strong dialect characterization. How did you arrive at his speech, and what

                <u who="WF">He represents the—the older class of Southerner. He was not
                    quite illiterate in his time as the—as a Snopes would be in his. He
                    had a close association with people that—that were literate. But he too belongs to

                    that "s" from Sophonisba to Sophonsiba, a change just of the "s" not of the
                    accent, is that your—is that intentional?</u>
                <u who="WF">Intentional in this sense: to imply that the people of her
                    class and her time were involved with books, with culture, but they were
                    careless with it too, and they would mispronounce the names, they would take
                    classical names and give to the Negro slaves and would probably mispronounce
                    them, so that after the Negro had passed it on to his children it became
                    something else, but at one time it came out of the classics, that someone who
                    had read the Latin or the Greek had seen it.</u></div2>

                <u who="WF">No, of course not deliberately. It's a—a—a concept
                    that the Compson would speak a little differently from a Snopes, or from an
                    intermediate between Compson and Snopes. That's a matter of the
                    ear, that these people—when a writer gets the character properly on
                    his feet, the character takes charge of things. The character says, "This is what

                <u who="WF">I told that in a book called <hi rend="italic">Requiem for a Nun</hi>.
                    It was the mail carrier, in 1811 or '12 it was, who brought the mail into what was
                    then an Indian trading post had—had been a tenant on Mr. Jefferson's
                    place, one of Mr. Jefferson's places here in Albemarle County. It's an involved,
                    long story, but it explains how they named the town Jefferson.</u>

                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, in your writing of dialogues, do you present the words of
                    your characters as they would have spoken them? Or do you just use a touch of
                    dialect to color the character?</u>
                <u who="WF">I think it's best to use as little dialect as possible because it
                    confuses people who are not familiar with it. That nobody should let the
                    character speak completely in his own vernacular.  It's best indicated by a few
                    simple, sparse but recognizable touches.</u></div2>

                    <head>Child Narrators</head>
                    <u who="RK">Mr. Faulkner, I'd like to ask you a question if it's not too involved
                    along those lines. Last week we were talking about the use of dialect to
                    differentiate the classes that people originated in, the social classes, the
                    geographical location. I was wondering perhaps about the use of language of a
                    child narrator. I've noticed in, say for example "That Evening Sun," lots of
                    Quentin's sentences seem short and perhaps the way a child might speak them and
                    yet it's pretty grown-up for a nine-year-old to report all of the things he
                    does. I wonder whether you'd comment on his rather accurate reporting.</u>
                <u who="WF">One has to take liberties to that extent. I think that some of the
                    things that Huck Finn recorded he couldn't have done at his age. That's the
                    liberties which the writer must take in order to make his story clear and
                    interesting.</u>
                <u who="RK">And yet we—we assume his point of view throughout the story, is
                    that not so?</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes, that his point of view is still that of his age, even though his

                <u who="WF">I think that his—his vernacular, his dialect wouldn't alter so
                    much as his vocabulary might increase a little because of radio and books
                    and—and newspapers which he can get or he can't escape from getting in

                    <u who="ES">Let me put in a sort of a variation on that question. Do you try to make
                    any distinction between what you conceive today to be the speech, say, of the

                    out certain peculiarities about the Southern dialect. Now these articles were
                    written by men who—in the Mississippi and Louisiana area. The
                    inconsistency seems to appear in the fact that some of these examples that they
                    show are not consistent with examples shown in the Georgia dialect, or perhaps
                    in the Carolinas. My question is this: do you think that there could possibly be
                    a split in the Southern dialect, between the Carolinas and Georgia, and perhaps
                    draw a rough line down Alabama, and have a different dialect on your side?</u>

                    influence. I think that the dialect would be consistent more by contour lines.
                    As Mr. Stevenson spoke of, the people of the lowlands speak differently from the
                    people in the hills, so the people in the north Alabama hills and east Tennessee
                    hills and Georgia hills would speak a dialect. The people in the flatlands of
                    Georgia, the flatlands of Alabama and Mississippi would speak a dialect, which
                    would be almost identical. The people along the coast would speak a dialect
                    colored just a little by the influence of Spanish and French and Creole.</u></div2>

                    refer to the use of alliteration. And let me read you a sentence from "Barn
                    Burning," and note the alliteration on the "s" sounds. "His two hulking
                    sisters"—this is the little boy's point of view—"His two
                    hulking sisters in their Sunday dresses and his mother and her sister in calico
                    and sunbonnets were already in it, sitting on and among the sorry residue of the
                    dozen and more movings which even the boy could remember." Was that a conscious
                    use of alliteration, or is it just happenstance?</u>
                <u who="WF">Happenstance.</u>
                <u who="ES"><unclear>Sure enough.</unclear> Do you ever use alliteration
                    consciously?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, I don't have time. <event desc="audience laughter"/> I mean by that
                    the writer is too busy getting the story down before he forgets it to bother too
                    much about his grammar or his style or the tricks he might use.</u>
                <u who="ES">But in the process of revision mightn't you scratch out sometimes and
                    substitute something which you think would sound a little better?</u>
                <u who="WF">A reviser would but nobody is going to revise if he can help it. That
                    is, nobody revises for fun. If it's all right he lets it go. The publisher can
                    correct the grammar if he thinks it's needed.</u></div2>
