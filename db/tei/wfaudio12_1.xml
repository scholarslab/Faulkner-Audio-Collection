						<writing type="fiction">Because they knew exactly where Tomey's Turl had
							gone, he went there every time he could slip off, which was about twice
							a year. He was heading for Mr Hubert Beauchamp's place just over the
							edge of the next county, that Mr Hubert's sister, Miss Sophonsiba (Mr
							Hubert was a bachelor too, like Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy) was still
							trying to make people call Warwick after the place in England that she
							said Mr Hubert was probably the true earl of only he never even had
							enough pride, not to mention energy, to take the trouble to establish
							his just rights. Tomey's Turl would go there to hang around Mr Hubert's
							girl, Tennie, until somebody came and got him. They couldn't keep him at
							home by buying Tennie from Mr Hubert because Uncle Buck said he and
							Uncle Buddy had so many niggers already that they could hardly walk
							around on their own land for them, and they couldn't sell Tomey's Turl
							to Mr Hubert because Mr Hubert said he not only wouldn't buy Tomey's
							Turl, he wouldn't have that damn white half-McCaslin on his place even
							as a free gift, not even if Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy were to pay board
							and keep for him. And if somebody didn't go and get Tomey's Turl right
							away, Mr Hubert would fetch him back himself, bringing Miss Sophonsiba,
							and they would stay for a week or longer, Miss Sophonsiba living in
							Uncle Buddy's room and Uncle Buddy moved clean out of the house,
							sleeping in one of the cabins in the quarters where the niggers used to
							live in his great-grandfather's time until his great-grandfather
							died and Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy moved all the niggers into the big
							house which his great-grandfather had not had time to finish, and not
							even doing the cooking while they were there and not even coming to the
							house any more except to sit on the front gallery after supper, sitting
							in the darkness between Mr Hubert and Uncle Buck until after a while
							even Mr Hubert would give up telling how many more head of niggers and
							acres of land he would add to what he would give Miss Sophonsiba when
							she married, and go to bed. And one midnight last summer Uncle Buddy
							just happened by accident to wake and hear Mr Hubert drive out of the
							lot and by the time he waked them and they got Miss Sophonsiba up and
							dressed and the team put to the wagon and caught Mr Hubert, it was
							almost daylight. So it was always he and Uncle Buck who went to fetch
							Tomey's Turl because Uncle Buddy never went anywhere, not even to town
							and not even to fetch Tomey's Turl from Mr Hubert's, even though they
							all knew that Uncle Buddy would have risked it ten times as much as
							Uncle Bud—Buck—Buck could have dared.</writing>

							hadn't even had it out of the drawer since that night last summer when

							theirs, where ladies were so damn seldom thank God that a man could ride
							for days in a straight line without having to dodge a single one. His
							grandmother (she was Uncle Buck's and Uncle Buddy's sister; she had
							raised him following his mother's death. That was where he had got his
							christian name: McCaslin, Carothers McCaslin Edmonds) said that Uncle
							Buck and Uncle Buddy both used the necktie just as another way of daring
							people to say they looked like twins, because even at sixty they would
							still fight anyone who claimed he could tell—could not tell them apart;
							whereupon his father had answered that any man who ever played poker
							once with Uncle Buddy would never misjudge him again for Uncle Buck or
							anybody else. </writing>

							hard little gray eyes and his white-stubbled jaw, his foot in the iron
							and the horse already moving, already running at the open gate when
							Uncle Buck came into the seat. He scrabbled up too, onto the shorter
							pony, before Jonas could boost him up, clapping the pony with his heels
							into its own stiff, short-coupled canter, out the gate after Uncle Buck,
							when Uncle Buddy (he hadn't even noticed him) stepped out from the gate
							and caught the bit. "Watch him," Uncle Buddy said. "Watch Theophilus.

						<writing type="fiction">Uncle Buck was riding Black John, because if they
							could just catch sight of Tomey's Turl at least one mile from Mr
							Hubert's gate, Black John would ride him down in two minutes. So when
							they came out on the long flat about three miles from Mr Hubert's, sure
							enough, there was Tomey's Turl on the Jake mule about a mile ahead.
							Uncle Buck flung his arm out and back, reining in, crouched on the big
							horse, his little round head and his gnarled neck thrust forward like a
							cooter's. "Stole away!" he whispered. "You stay back where he wont see
							you and flush. I'll circle him through the woods and we will bay him at

					<u who="WF">
						<writing type="fiction">He waited until Uncle Buck had vanished into the
							woods. Then he went on. But Tomey's Turl saw him. He was closed—he
							closed in too fast; maybe he was afraid he wouldn't be there in time to
							see him when he treed. It was the best race he had ever seen. He had
							never seen old Jake go that fast, and nobody had ever known Tomey's Turl
							to go faster than his natural walk, even riding a mule. Uncle Buck
							whooped once from the woods, running on sight, then Black John came out
							of the trees, driving, soupled out flat and level as a hawk, with Uncle
							Buck right up—up behind his ears now and yelling so they looked
							exactly like a big black hawk with a sparrow riding it, across the field
							and over the ditch and across the next field, and he was running too;
							the mare went out before he even knew she was ready, he was yelling
							too. Because, being a nigger, Tomey's Turl should have jumped down and
							run for it afoot as soon as he seen them. But he didn't; maybe Tomey's
							Turl had been running off from Uncle Buck for so long that he had even
							got used to running away like a white man would do it. And it was like
							he and old Jake had added Tomey's Turl's natural walking speed to the
							best that old Jake had ever done in his life, and it was just exactly
							enough to beat Uncle Buck to the ford. Because when he and the pony
							arrived, Uncle—Black John was blown and lathered and Uncle Buck was
							down, leading him around in a circle slow—to slow him down, and they
							could already hear Mr Hubert's dinner horn a mile away. </writing>
