  <p> not

  <p>Yes, sir.</p>

  <p>Would you believe that
						this system&#x2014;it seems to me that this is a certain class of people,
					and it may prevail because we have television. We have certain
						standardizations. But I&#x2014;I still think there are as many
					individuals growing up now as there were in times before.</p>

  <p>Mr. Faulkner, how does a man who
					works in a chewing gum factory in Detroit communicate with a man who shepherds
					sheep in Algeria? Let's say that they're both simple, pensive
					men, and you put them together. This is the man-to-man
					confrontation that you speak of. On what terms can they communicate?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.5"/>
  <p>Don't you think nowadays that
					possibly there are a great many individuals whom&#x2014;whom you don't recognize as
					individuals because they don't&#x2014;don't seem to be doing anything, and that's where
					they are individuals&#x2014;they're not belonging? They're not necessarily worrying
					about the next ?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.6"/>
  <p>You're saying
					the solution is talk to everybody?</p>
</div>

  <p>And I would say that your
						mass man is a creation of western civilization. I don't
					think he exists in India. I must say  individual of the individual
					which is probably so intense. There again, I was very much
						struck. I couldn't help wondering whether all this about the
					howling and the hardship of the present generation couldn't be found very much
					more profoundly if you look at the lives of the poets and
						 the lives of Dickens, and the hardships . Aren't
					we merely basing ourselves upon the Cadillac standard? He doesn't have
						any ideals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.8"/>
  <p> to inform you how 
					howl  juxtaposed to the academics, I suppose . Now, my point is that
					these are extremes of the arts. One is the&#x2014;the breaking away, which is not
						true  howl, not speech, and I juxtapose this to the
					academic poets.  And I think we used the term a&#x2014;just a shrill shriek. Now, this is not
					speech. Speech is somewhere in the middle.</p>
</div>

  <p>Mr. Faulkner,  background of
						the San Francisco poets. They seem to get together in a
					group and play music and generally carouse while they create.
					And I was wondering how this would fit in with your ideas that the artist is an
					individual. Can they be individuals when they're creating as a group?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

  <p>Sir, do you think economically
					hard times could aid creative energy? People can't go on buying pricey cars and
					living , and it seems like a little more aggressive spirit. In
						times like this, if there were a real recession, it might not harm
					some of the individualism that seems to die if there is plenty of
						everything. Do you agree at all?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.11"/>
  <p>Mr. Faulkner, your&#x2014;your&#x2014;your speech of
					acceptance of the Nobel Prize was one of the most encouraging things that I've
					ever heard said in my very long lifetime. You haven't changed your mind, have you?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.12"/>
  <p>Mr. Faulkner, I can't resist asking 
						one more question a propos of what you've just said&#x2014;interests me considerably.
					If the poet must not address himself to the world to try to change it but
					must write what's in him, what he knows, then is the benefit which the poet is
					to give to the world to come from the world's recognition of what he writes or
					is he to find some point in between, writing in and of himself exclusively and
					writing what the world needs for him to write? I'm not sure whether&#x2014;where&#x2014;where
					a poet must fall in that dilemma, if it is a dilemma.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.13"/>
  <p>Mr. Faulkner, isn't it possible,
					though, that these eternal verities may be spoken of in certain styles,
					addressed to contemporaries and yet misunderstood and therefore neglected?
					Aren't there&#x2014;aren't there writers who are addressed by their contemporary
						audiences who are totally neglected because of the&#x2014;of the manner in which they were
					addressed and not because of the subject matter?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.14"/>
  <p>How do you feel about The Hamlet being made into a movie and did you work on
					the script of that?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.15"/>
  <p>Mr. Faulkner, did you say that the
					highest form of endeavors is not to sit back and say, "Well, I won't be a part
					of this," but it's saying that "It's is sad, and I'm going to do something about
					it." How&#x2014;how do you reconcile this to what you say, the fact that the writer
					shouldn't care whether he makes any effect on society?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.16"/>
  <p>I&#x2014;I disagree with you. Some of the
					greatest poetry in the English literature is didactic. It's teaching, preaching
						poetry. I mean, Wordsworth was one of them, I think. I
					think we underrate the&#x2014;the&#x2014;the didactic element in
					poetry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.17"/>
  <p>Sir, last spring you spoke of the
					work of&#x2014;when you were asked, of William Styron and Shelby Foote and Warren Eyster
					as young writers whose novels elicited some approval from you. They seemed
					promising writers. Do you think that the fact that they, as far as I know,
					write&#x2014;do not write about cities gives them more of a possibility for showing the
					human heart in conflict with itself?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.18"/>
  <p>You'd feel that Salinger, for
					example, just hasn't created enough characters who seem to be a part of this big
					human race. There isn't just a&#x2014;there just isn't enough for Holden Caulfield to
					come in contact with before he can get anywhere?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.19"/>
  <p>Mr. Faulkner&#x2014;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio23_2.20"/>
  <p>But isn't it just as greatly
					pronounced in the 19th century novels, both English and French, Dickens' Great 
						Expectations or Stendhal's Red and the Black, the heroes in both of those novels?  Aren't they
					betrayed once they tried to touch out or reach out and touch society?</p>
