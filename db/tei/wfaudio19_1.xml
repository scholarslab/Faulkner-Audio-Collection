					<head>Introduction</head>
					<u who="B">For a while Dublin had
					James Joyce.  For a while Lübech had Thomas Mann.  For a while,
					happily, Charlottesville has had William Faulkner. And as Dublin and
					Lübech were home to Joyce and Mann, so we hope that Mr. Faulkner will
					regard Charlottesville as a kind of second home. In adding up some year's end
					statistics, we found that Mr. Faulkner had met on twenty-four different
					occasions with undergraduate and graduate classes, with university
					organizations, and with groups such as this one today. These audiences totaled
					more than fifteen hundred people. In his office on the fifth floor of Cabell
					Hall, he has held office hours two hours a day, six days a week throughout the
					semester. Besides being the most punctual and faithful man in the department in
					keeping office hours, he has, we estimate, counseled more than one hundred and
					fifty University of Virginia students. Speaking of the University and its
					students some time ago, Mr. Jefferson said, "I hope its influence on their
					virtue, freedom, fame, and happiness will be salutary and permanent." We think
					this is an accurate description of the service Mr. Faulkner has performed. It
					has been some time since one could say of a novel that it was both on the
					best-seller list and also the work of a Nobel-Prize winner. One can say this of
						<hi rend="italic">The Town</hi>, and it is from this novel that Mr. Faulkner
					will read briefly this afternoon. Then he will answer any questions you care to
					put to him. Around the turn of the century, opera impresarios used to arrange
					very extended farewell tours for some of their stars. During the past few weeks
					both <hi rend="italic">Time Magazine</hi> and some newspapers have reported Mr.
					Faulkner's last appearances, but now, for positively the last time this season,

					<head>Faulkner's Introduction</head>
					<u who="WF">This interminable valedictory does
					seem to be coming to an end at last. I have tried to express to Mr. Gwynn and
					Mr. Blotner how much pleasure I have had here. I would like to say to the people
					of Charlottesville, too, how much pleasure this has been for me. It's been so
					much pleasure, that I am a little concerned about whether it could have done any
					good or not, that anything this much fun must be bad

					<head>Story, Excerpt 1</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction"> There is a ridge; you drive on beyond Seminary Hill and
						in time you come upon it: a mild unhurried farm road presently mounting to
						cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from Jefferson to
						the world. And now, looking back and down, you see all Yoknapatawpha in the
						dying last of day beneath you. There are stars now, just pricking out as you
						watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning; the end of
						day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith.
						Yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth, drained from
						earth backward and upward into that cooling green, but rather had gathered,
						pooling for an unmoving moment yet, among the low places of the ground so
						that ground, earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are
						dark, standing dark and immobile out of it.

					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">Then, as though at signal, the fireflies—lightning-bugs
						of the Mississippi child's vernacular—myriad and frenetic, random and
						frantic, pulsing; not questing, not quiring, but choiring as if they were
						tiny incessant appeaseless voices, cries, words. And you stand suzerain and
						solitary above the whole sum of your life beneath that incessant ephemeral
						spangling. First is Jefferson, the center, radiating weakly its puny glow
						into space; beyond it, enclosing it, spreads the County, tied by the
						diverging roads to that center as is the rim to the hub by its spokes,
						yourself detached as God Himself for this moment above the cradle of your
						nativity and of the men and women who made you, the record and chronicle of
						your native land proffered for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like
						the ripples on living water above the dreamless slumber of your past; you to
						preside unanguished and immune above this miniature of man's passions and
						hopes and disasters—ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation
						and pity and honor and sin and pride all bound, precarious and ramshackle,
						held together by the web, the iron-thin warp and woof of his rapacity but
						withal yet dedicated to his dreams.

					<head>Story, Excerpt 3</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">They are all here, supine beneath you, stratified and
						superposed, osseous and durable with the frail dust and the phantoms—the
						rich alluvial river-bottom land of old Issetibbeha, the wild Chickasaw king,
						with his Negro slaves and his sister's son called Doom who murdered his way
						to the throne and, legend said (record itself said since there were old men
						in the county in my childhood who had actually seen it), stole an entire
						steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles overland to convert into a
						palace proper to aggrandise his state; the same fat black rich plantation
						earth still synonymous of the proud fading white plantation names whether
						we—I mean of course they—ever actually owned a plantation or not: Sutpen and
						Sartoris and Compson and Edmonds and McCaslin and Beauchamp and Grenier and
						Habersham and Holston and Stevens and De Spain, generals and governors and
						judges, soldiers (even if only Cuban lieutenants) and statesmen failed or
						not, and simple politicians and over-reachers and just simple failures, who
						snatched and grabbed and passed and vanished, name, face and all. Then
						the roadless, almost pathless perpendicular hill-country of McCallum and
						Gowrie and Frazier and Muir translated intact with their pot stills and still 
						peaking only—speaking only the old Gaelic and not much of that, from Culloden to
						Carolina, then from Carolina to Yokpatawpha still intact and still speaking not 
						much of anything except that they now called the pots "kettles" though the drink
						(even I can remember this) was still usquebaugh; then and last on to where
						Frenchman's Bend lay beyond the south—southeastern horizon, cradle of Varners and
						ant-heap of the northeast crawl of Snopes.

					<head>Story, Excerpt 4</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">And you stand there—you, the old man, already
						white-headed (because it doesn't matter if they call your gray hairs
						premature because life itself is always premature which is why it aches and
						anguishes) and pushing forty, only a few years from forty—while there rises
						up to you, proffered up to you, the spring darkness, the unsleeping darkness
						which, although it is of the dark itself, declines the dark since dark is of
						the little death called sleeping. Because look how, even though the last of
						west is no longer green and all of firmament is now one unlidded studded
						slow-wheeling arc and the last of earth-pooled visibility has drained away,
						there still remains one faint diffusion, since everywhere you look about the
						dark panorama you can still see them, faint as whispers: the faint and shapeless
						lambence of dogwood blooming return loaned light to light as the phantoms
						of candles would.

					<writing type="fiction">And you, the old man, standing there while there rises
						to you, about you, suffocating you, the spring dark peopled and myriad, two
						and two seeking never at all solitude but simply privacy, the privacy
						decreed and created for them by the spring darkness, the spring weather, the
						spring which an—which an American poet, a fine one, a woman and so she knows, called
						girls' weather and boys' luck. Which was not the first day at all, not Eden
						morning at all because girls' weather and boys' luck is the sum of all the
						days: the cup, the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no
						more; proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even that
						sometimes premature, too soon. Because the tragedy of life is, it must be
						premature, inconclusive and inconcludable, in order to be life; it must be
						before itself, in advance of itself, to have been at all. </writing></u></div2>

					Snopeses by some desire for simple decency. Maybe it's just in order to get
					along with—with his fellow men and women in Jefferson, but he will cope with 
					Snopeses and—and what is good in our country will—will still endure. It may

					no degrees of it. It's either first-rate or it's bad. It's rotten. Then he tries
					short stories, which is the next severe medium. When that fails, then he goes to the
					novel. <event desc="audience laughter"/> That is, he wants first to take—take
					the tragedy and passion of—of experience, of life, and put it into fourteen

					Passion Week or a pattern of—of any Christian legend or even the language of the
					Bible, though I'm—I'm quite sure that the—that the deliberate intent was there,
					but how much I—I can't say because I think the writer, when he is busy telling
					his story, he hasn't really got time to think about style or—or about the
					pattern of—of his—his sentences. He's too busy.  But anyone writing writes from
					his own experience, his own observations, his own imagination, and all he has
					read is a part of his experience, and so in the—the heat and fury of—of
					composing his piece, he will reach back into his memory, and he will dig up all
					sorts of things and will fit them into the joint just as the carpenter does with
					a board until he finds the one that—that makes the best joint or makes the—the
					soundest corner or the driest roof, and so I think that no man can say just how

					make a much better job than that. <event desc="audience laughter"/> And any

						the time you were writing it?</u>
				<u who="WF">I doubt if a writer ever reads his—his book again. <event desc="audience laughter"/> 
					I think that—that—that's one saving thing he has
					in his craft, that every time he writes a book, he knows that's one book he
					won't have to read. <event desc="audience laughter"/> Also, the reason that the
					writer writes another book is that one that he finished wasn't quite good enough
					to suit him, and he don't want to read that book anymore. He wants to forget
					that book because he's trying to write the next one, which may be good enough.
					Of course, he knows that one probably won't be good enough, too, but that's what
					keeps him going. That's why, taken by and large, his life is so happy. He has
					something to wake up tomorrow morning to—to need to do, not to want to do, but
					to need to do, that drives him to do it. But it's never quite good enough for
					him, so he doesn't need to read it again. He's not interested in what anybody
					else thinks about it because he himself knows it ain't good enough for him, and
					that's the only opinion he really cares about.</u></div2>

					a bottle of whiskey, and he would talk, and I would listen. In the morning, I
					wouldn't see him. He'd be in seclusion working. And that would go on day after

					laugh and talk, in the mornings, in seclusion working. And I thought that if
					that was all it took to be a writer, that was exactly the life for me. 
					<event desc="audience laughter"/> So, I—I started a book, and right away I found that
					it was fun, that I liked it, and I got so interested in it, I forgot about Mr.
					Anderson. I hadn't seen him for several weeks, and I met Mrs. Anderson on the
					street. She said, "What's wrong? Are you mad at us? We haven't seen you in a
					long time." I said, "No, ma'am. I'm writing book." She said, "Good God." 
					<event desc="audience laughter"/> I—I met her a week or two after, and she asked
					about the book. I said I was just about to finish it. She said, "Do you want
					Sherwood to read it?" I hadn't thought of anybody reading it. I said, "Well'm,
					he can if wants to." She said, "Well, Sherwood says he'll make a swap with you.
					If he don't have to read that book, he'll tell his publisher to take it." So I
					said, "Done," <event desc="audience laughter"/> and he told his publisher to
					take the book, and that's how I became—took up writing seriously. Up to that
					time, I'd done it—well, it never occurred to me that anybody might want to read it or
					hadn't thought of it in public terms till then.</u>
				<u who="Q">But if you hadn't met Sherwood Anderson, it would have been inevitable,
					though.</u>
				<u who="WF">Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. I think the writer is driven by a demon that he
					can't help himself anymore. That's a vice, really. Nothing he can do about it.

				<u who="WF">Well, as I said, any writer is completely amoral, that he has very
					likely stolen it from somewhere, but then he has no qualms about that because
					anyone after him that steals from him flatters him, and he assumes that every
					other writer feels that way. There are so few things to write about, and the—the
					human condition changes so slowly, that very likely almost any situation, except
					for a few minor differences, has already been written about by somebody, and
					very likely you read it somewhere. That reading to me is part of one's
					experience, as much of one's experience as—as dealing with actual flesh—fresh—flesh 
					and blood people, but there's—I'm sure that any writer is ready to admit that he
					has stolen from everything he ever read, and he has read everything from the

					kleptomania, it's a little of kleptomania.  But—rather more of—of whatever it
					is that makes the magpie pick up everything or the packrat pick up anything
					that's loose. I think that's the way the writer goes through life, through books
					and through the actual living world, too. That he misses very little, not
					because he's made up his mind before breakfast not to miss anything today, but
					because those muscles do it for him, and when the need comes, he digs out
					things that he didn't know where he saw them, which to him don't matter. He may
					have stolen it—he probably did—but to him that's not important. The important
					thing is if he uses it worthily. If he makes some base use of it then, of
					course, it's a shame. But he wants to—when he steals, he wants—he wants the
					owner that he stole from to approve of what he did with it, or not to disapprove
					too much. <event desc="end of recording"/></u></div2>
