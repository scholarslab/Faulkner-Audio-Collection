					introduction today because it's always a pleasure for me to introduce and for
					all of us to hear our speaker, but it's with regret, too, because this is our
					last session today. It's our last session with the world's greatest living
					novelist and with our own Writer-in-Residence, who today will read from the book
					he has referred to as his favorite, <hi rend="italic">The Sound and the
						Fury</hi>. He'll read from Dilsey's section, and at the conclusion of his
					reading, he will answer such questions as you care to put to him. I'll resist at
					this time all temptations to quote lines of poetry, to say <hi rend="italic">ave
						atque vale</hi> or anything of that sort, because we hope to see him again
					and again in Charlottesville in the years to come. Mr. William Faulkner.

					<head>Faulkner's Introduction</head>
					<u who="WF">Since this is my last day here in my
					sojourn as Writer-in-Residence, I could use this last hour to try to say thank
					you to the people of Albemarle County and Charlottesville and the University for
					making my stay here this pleasant and this happy. I won't do that. I won't even
					say goodbye. Every individual is the sum total of his past, so when I leave
					here, I will leave something of Faulkner in Albemarle County, where Faulkner was
					happy. When I go away, I will take with me something of
					Albemarle County. I will always come back so that those two separates can be
					joined again. I won't need to say goodbye. And each time I come back, I'll be
					saying, "Much obliged."

						<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">The road rose again, to a scene like a painted backdrop.
						Notched into a cut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop
						short off, like a cut ribbon. Beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy
						steeple like a painted church, and the whole scene was as flat and without
						perspective as a painted cardboard set upon the ultimate edge of the flat
						earth, against the windy sunlight of space and April and a midmorning filled
						with bells. Toward the church they thronged with slow sabbath deliberation,
						the women and children went on in, the men stopped outside and talked in
						quiet groups until the bell ceased ringing. Then they too entered.<lb/>
						The
						church had been decorated, with sparse flowers from kitchen gardens and
						hedgerows, and with streamers of colored crepe paper. Above the pulpit hung
						a battered Christmas bell, the accordion sort that collapses. The pulpit was
						empty, though the choir was already in place, fanning themselves although it
						was not warm.</writing>

					<head>Story, Excerpt 2</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">Most of the women were gathered on one side of the room.
						They were talking. Then the bell struck one time and they dispersed to their
						seats and the congregation sat for an instant, expectant. The bell struck
						again one time. The choir rose and began to sing and the congregation turned
						its head as one as six small children—four girls with tight
						pigtails bound with small scraps of cloth like butterflies, and two boys
						with close napped heads—entered and marched up the aisle, strung
						together in a harness of white ribbons and flowers, and followed by two men
						in single file. The second man was huge, of a light coffee color, imposing
						in a frock coat and white tie. His head was magisterial and profound, his
						neck rolled above his collar in rich folds. But he was familiar to them, and
						so the heads were still reverted when he had passed, and it was not until
						the choir ceased singing that they realised that the visiting clergyman had
						already entered, and when they saw the man who had preceded their minister
						enter the pulpit still ahead of him an indescribable sound went up, a sigh,
						a sound of astonishment and disappointment.

					<head>Story, Excerpt 3</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">The visitor was undersized, in a shabby alpaca coat. He
						had a wizened black face like a small, aged monkey. And all the while that
						the choir sang again and while the six children rose and sang in thin,
						frightened, tuneless whispers, they watched the insignificant looking man
						sitting dwarfed and countrified by the minister's imposing bulk, with
						something like consternation. They were still looking at him with
						consternation and unbelief when the minister rose and introduced him in
						rich, rolling tones whose very unction served to increase the visitor's
						insignificance.<lb/>
						"En dey brung dat all de way fum Saint Looey," Frony
						whispered.<lb/>
						"I've knowed de Lawd to use cuiser tools den dat," Dilsey

					<head>Story, Excerpt 4</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">When the visitor rose to speak he sounded like a white
						man. His voice was level and cold. It sounded too big to have come from him
						and they listened at first through with curiosity, as they would have to a monkey
						talking. They began to watch him as they would a man on a tight rope. They
						even forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which he ran
						and poised and swooped upon the cold inflectionless wire of his voice, so
						that at last, when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again
						beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and
						his monkey body as reft of all motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel, the
						congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a
						little in its seats. Behind the pulpit the choir fanned steadily. Dilsey
						whispered, "Hush, now. Dey fixin to sing in a minute."

					<head>Story, Excerpt 5</head>
					<u who="WF">
						<writing type="fiction">Then a voice said, "Brethren."<lb/>
							The preacher had not
						moved. His arm lay yet across the desk, and he still held that pose while
						the voice died in sonorous echoes between the walls. It was as different as
						day and dark from his former tone, with a sad, timbrous quality like an alto
						horn, sinking into their hearts and speaking there again when it had ceased
							in fading and cumulate echoes.<lb/>
							"Brethren and sisteren," it said again.
						The preacher removed his arm and he began to walk back and forth before the
						desk, his hands clasped behind him, a meagre figure, hunched over upon
						itself like that of one long immured in striving with the implacable earth,
						"I got the recollection and the blood of the Lamb!" He tramped steadily back
						and forth beneath the twisted paper and the Christmas bell, hunched, his
						hands clasped behind him. He was like a worn small rock whelmed by the
						successive waves of his voice. With his body he seemed to feed that voice
						that, succubus like, had fleshed its teeth in him. And the congregation
						seemed to watch with its own eyes while the voice consumed him, until he was
						nothing and they were nothing and there was not even a voice but instead
						their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measures beyond the
						need for words, so that when he came to rest again against the reading desk, his
						monkey face lifted and his whole attitude that of a serene, tortured
						crucifix that transcended its shabbiness and insignificance and made it of
						no moment, a long moaning expulsion of breath rose from them, and a woman's
						single soprano: "Yes, Jesus!"

						knee. Two tears slid down her fallen cheeks, in and out of the myriad
						coruscations of immolation and abnegation and time.<lb/>
						"Brethren," the
						minister said in a harsh whisper, without moving.<lb/>
						"Yes, Jesus!" the
						woman's voice said, hushed yet.<lb/>
						"Breddren en sistuhn!" His voice rang
						again, with the horns. He removed his arm and stood erect and raised his
						hands. "I got de ricklickshun en de blood of de Lamb!" They did not mark
						just when his intonation, his pronunciation, became negroid, they just sat
						swaying a little in their seats as the voice took them into itself.<lb/>
						
						"When de long, cold—Oh, I tells you, breddren, when de long, cold.

					experience the writer has ever suffered is going to influence what he does, and
					that is not only what he's read, but the music he's heard, the pictures he's

					him. He is frail and fragile, a web of flesh and bone and mostly water. He's
					flung willy nilly into a ramshackle universe stuck together with electricity.
						<event desc="audience laughter"/> The problems he faces are always a little
					bigger than he is, and yet, amazingly enough, he copes with them, not
					individually but—but as a race. He endures. He's outlasted dinosaurs.
					He's outlasted atom bombs. He'll outlast communism. Simply because there's some
						part in him that keeps him from ever knowing that he's
					whipped, I suppose. That as frail as he is, he—he lives up to his
					codes of behavior. He shows compassion when there's no reason why he should.
					He's braver than he should be. He's more honest. The writer is—is so
					interested, he sees this as so amazing and—and you might say so
					beautiful. Anyway, it—it's so moving to him that he wants to put it
					down on paper or in music or on canvas, that he simply wants to isolate one of
					these instances in which man—frail, foolish man—has acted

					before you begin it, which is <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi>, but most of them begin with some
					incident in which man is acting in that gallant way despite his fragility.
					Others begin with a character who has in himself the seed of tragedy. After

					notebook and put down what they say and do. They've taken charge by

				</u>
				<u who="WF">Why, if you will agree that the writer is never quite satisfied
					with—with anything he does, then none of them are difficult or none of
					them are easy.  That emotion—the emotion the character shows is simply
					one of the—the tools in the craftsman's toolbox, and when he needs to
					show anger, he can always steal from somebody else that has shown anger and copy
					it. If he believes in his characters enough, and they themselves have stood up
					on their own hind legs and begun to move, then all he has to do is just put down
					what they say and do, that he doesn't have
					to—to create emotional states for them. They're doing that. He just is

				<u who="WF">I prefer to think that—that no writer has got time to be too
					concerned with style, that he is simply telling this dramatic instance in the
					most effective way he knows, that the book, the story, creates its own style.
					Long and involved sentences—I don't like them any—any more
					than the people that have to read them do, but I couldn't think of any, to me,
					better, more effective, way to tell what I was trying to tell.  And it's not
					really an evolution, simply that—that one story in my opinion
					demanded, compelled a certain diction and style. The story next to it has
					compelled a completely different one.

				<u who="WF">Well, I wouldn't have any wants in the matter. I have done the best I

					they will—will come in a group like this asking questions. It may be
					that that's a poor habit for an—an aged writer like me to form, that

					In that way, it may damage his work a little, but
