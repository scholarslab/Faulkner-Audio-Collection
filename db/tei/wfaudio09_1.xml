                    the answerer will approve of. I think that's not—not a very good idea,
                    so ask anything that—that you like.

                    supposed to be a Christ figure.
                    Now, there's some allusion to that or perhaps some evidence for it. He died at 33
                        <unclear>at</unclear> his lynching. There's a few things like that. Did you
                    intend for him to be a Christ figure?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, not deliberately. That was coincidental. The writer has
                    a—a storeroom of—of recollections, of traditions, of
                    experience, of observation, that he uses in his trade, just as the carpenter has
                    a storeroom of planks that he uses when he wants to build a fence or a house,
                    and that's coincidental. I am writing about people, not about symbols, but when
                    it seems to me the symbol is a—a good trick to use, then I will use

                <u who="WF">No, I am a very disorderly person. I don't know anything about discipline,
                    and that system works with some writers, but it never has worked with me. I put
                    off writing as long as I can because I don't like the—the mechanics
                    of—of getting the words down on paper. I put it off as long as
                    possible, and then when I can't put it off any longer, I seem to have generated
                    enough back pressure to where it goes for 10 or 12 hours some
                    day—sometimes. Then I will go to bed and sleep, and I will eat. Then I
                    will write again for ten or twelve hours the next day, until the steam runs out,
                    and then I will do nothing as long as I can put it off. <event desc="audience laughter"/>

                <u who="WF">The writer has three sources: imagination, observation, and experience,
                    and he probably can't say himself just how much of which he has used when. I do
                    think that he feels that he can improve just a little on—on the world
                    as God made it and on people as God made them because he has got to do his job
                    in, well, five hours where God can take sixty years to complete a—a—a
                    human being. I think that the writer himself don't know how much he saw, how
                    much he imagined, how much he remembered, how much he read, but he certainly has
                    no compunctions about taking what he needs from any source. He will steal from
                    another writer without hesitation. <event desc="audience laughter"/> He will use
                    his own observation, his own experience without hesitation, no matter how 
                    unhappy or how shameful it might have been. Because he is trying to—to
                    create flesh and blood people that will have three dimensions, that
                    will—can stand up and cast a shadow behind them.

                    once they have come alive and have three dimensions, then they take charge of
                    the story. All I do is to run along at top speed behind them and try to put it
                    all down that they do and say. I've never—never used a plot,
                    and—and in my own case, I would waste my time if I tried to think of a

                    his own characters that he hasn't got time to find where they follow classical

                    conflict with himself and his fellows or—and his environment do follow
                    a pattern. Maybe they're—that—that the story of Oedipus was not the story
                    of Oedipus at all. It was the story of any man in that situation, that the
                    patterns—there're too few stories that one can tell. There're only two
                    or three stories actually, and any writer has got to repeat what was written

                    what he must do. It's a—a childish sort of recalcitrance, that
                    anyone—when he is told that he must do something, he will do the
                    opposite just to show them. It becomes a principle with him. He knows that he

                    been trying to change it by his own methods. He's too slow about it. He
                    should've known that this Supreme Court decision would be made. There was
                    a—a lawyer in my town that told people fifteen years ago that sooner
                    or later the Supreme Court would have to say that, but nobody believed him. They
                    were—in their—their slow way, they were doing things to improve the
                    Negro's condition. When the Supreme Court decision came out saying they must do
                    it now, people that—that were working in their slow way toward it,
                    took the other side. They say that the government shall not tell us what we will
                    do, can do, must do, in our own country, with our own people, with our own
                    culture and system.

                    bootlegger. I was a commercial aeroplane pilot. Then I got married, and I needed
                    money, and I had—had got the curse of writing then, so I thought I
                    would make a little money writing a book, and I thought of the most horrific
                    story I could imagine and wrote it, sent it to the publisher and he wrote back,
                    "Good God, if we print this, we'll both be in jail." <event desc="audience laughter"/> So I wrote two more books and forgot about it.
                    Then one day I got the galley proofs of <hi rend="italic">Sanctuary</hi>, and I
                    looked at it, and I didn't need money then probably, though I like to think that
                    I had gotten my breath and could see that the whole thing was basely conceived
                    for a base purpose, and I wrote the publisher, "Let's throw it away." He said, "We
                    can't do that because I have spent money to have plates made." And I said, "Well,
                    I'll have to rewrite it because I can't let it be printed this way." And he said,
                    "All right, if you will pay your half of the new plates, I'll pay half, and you can
                    rewrite it." So I got a job and earned the two hundred and seventy dollars to pay
                    my half of the new plates and rewrote the book, and this time, I did the best I
                    could with it. I'm—I'm not ashamed of the book as it is. I'm ashamed
                    of the—the primary base notion to write something to make money, which
                    I shouldn't have done, that I—I betrayed something somewhere when
                    I—when I did that, but I did the best I could with the material as it
                    was, and so I'm not ashamed of the book now. It's not one that I would do again,
                    but I'm not ashamed of it.</u></div2>

                    and—and he learns from his own people. Once he has conceived them
                    truthfully and has stuck to—to the verities of—of human
                    conduct, human behavior, human aspirations, then he learns. Yes, they teach him.
                    They surprise him.  They teach him things that he didn't know. They do things.
                    And suddenly he says to himself, "Why, yes, that is true, that is so."
