                    advice you get, I think, is not by asking for it. You—you get that
                    through some form of osmosis. You will get it from the books you read, from your
                    experiences in college. Every man has got to stand on his own feet, and I think
                    now that I wouldn't accept anyone's advice, that I would rather make my own
                    mistakes than to accept advice which—which might save me because I
                    know now that—that mistakes don't hurt you.</u>

                    about the University of Virginia, but the character would have to command that I
                    write about the University of Virginia. It's—it's not in—in
                    my line of work to say, "Now, I'm going to write a story about any place," and
                    then put people into it, that the people themselves say, "Come on here, Faulkner,

                    <head>List of Virtues</head>
                    <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">I—someone who talked to you gave a list of virtues. I've heard
                    you mention some of them tonight. Do you have that ready? <event desc="audience laughter"/> I think that courage and honesty were among your
                    list of virtues.</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, let's use a—a little better word to me than virtues.
                    They're the verities of the human heart. They are courage, honor, pride,
                    compassion, pity. That they are—they are not virtues. One doesn't try
                    to practice them, in my opinion, simply because they are good. One
                    practices—tries to practice them simply because they are the edifice
                    on which the whole history of man has been founded, and by means of which
                    his—as a race, he has endured this long. That
                    without—without those verities, he would have vanished, just like the
                    mastodon and the other ephemeral phenomena of nature which have come and gone in
                    the history of the world. Man has endured despite his frailty because he accepts
                    and believes in those verities, that one must be honest not because
                    it's—it's—it's virtuous, but because that's the only way to
                    get along. That if people lied constantly to one another, you would never know
                    where you were, you would never know what was going on. That if people didn't
                    practice compassion, there would be nothing to <unclear>defend</unclear> the
                    weak until they got enough strength to stand for themselves. If one didn't
                    practice something of—of pride, one would have nothing to be proud
                    about, to have said, "I—I did well.  I—I did nothing that I
                    was ashamed of. I can lie down with myself and sleep." That is, they
                    are—they are the verities to be practiced not because they are a
                    virtue but because that's the best way to live in peace with yourself and your
                        fellows.

                    You don't know what motivates him. You see him motivated; you see him doing
                    these things, but you don't see what motivates him. Do you start with knowing
                    what the character is and describe his motivations, describe his actions, and

                    <u who="WF">No, it is—is the writer's fault. Before the writer begins to put that
                    character down, he has got to understand him, and <unclear>if</unclear> he
                    hasn't made perfectly plain and coherent the motivations necessary to make that
                    character real to the reader, then the—the writer himself is at fault.
                    He hasn't, probably, learned enough of his craft by that time.  But to the
                    writer, of course, that character is—is intact and whole and is
                    breathing and is standing up, and if to the reader he doesn't stand up and is
                    not real and actual, then that is the fault of the craftsman.</u>
                <u who="Q">I didn't say—he's real and actual, and I realize this, but I
                    don't see the reasons for his actions until the—until the very end of
                    the book. I just didn't see why he did these things. I see that he did them, and

                <u who="WF">Well, you can meet an actual living creature or man, you can see him in
                    the throes of some action, and it won't be until after the action is complete
