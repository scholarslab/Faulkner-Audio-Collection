                <u who="Q">This question is about <hi rend="italic">Light in August</hi>. Could you
                    tell me your purpose in placing the chapter about Hightower's early life in the
                    end of the novel rather than when Hightower first appeared?</u>
                    <u who="WF">It may be this. Unless a—a book follows a—a simple direct line
                        such as a story of—of adventure, it becomes a—a series of pieces. It's a good deal
                    like—like dressing a showcase window. It takes a certain amount
                        of—of judgment and—and taste to arrange the different pieces in the most
                    effective place in juxtaposition to one another. That was the reason. It seemed
                    to me that was the most effective place to put that to—to underline
                    the— the tragedy of Christmas's story by the tragedy of—of
                    his antithesis. A man who—Hightower was a man who—who wanted
                    to be better than he was afraid he would. He had failed his wife. Here was
                    another chance he had, and he failed his—his Christian oath as a man
                    of God, and he escaped into—to his past where some member of his
                    family was brave enough to match the moment.  But it was put at that point in the
                    book, I think, because I thought that was the most effective place for
                    it.

                    <u who="Q">Sir, in "Delta Autumn," in a—the thoughts of Ike McCaslin when he's talking
                    to the colored girl, you write, "Maybe in a thousand or two thousand years in
                        America, but not now, not now." I was—I was wondering how you might apply that to the
                    present-day conditions that have happened since the writing of the story, with
                    the Supreme Court decision and what-not.</u>
                <u who="WF">He used "a thousand or two thousand years" in his despair. He had seen a
                    condition which was intolerable, which shouldn't be, but it was, and he was
                    saying, in effect, that—that this—this must be changed. This
                    cannot go on, but I'm too old to do anything about it, that maybe in a thousand
                    years, somebody will be young enough and strong enough to do something about it.
                    That was—that was all he meant by the numbers, but I think that he
                    saw, as—as everybody that thinks, that a condition like that is—is
                    intolerable, not so much intolerable to man's sense of justice but maybe
                    intolerable to—to a condition, to the condition, that—that
                    any country has reached the point where, if it is to endure, it must have no
                    inner conflicts based on a—a wrong, a basic human wrong.

                    person—real character, or is she made up out of your mind?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, no, I think a writer uses observation, experience, imagination. He
                    never knows just how much of which he does use, but I don't believe you can
                    write a very good or very moving story about a human being in the—the—the 
                    proscribed limits of—of a story or a book and take a human being from life. It
                    takes sixty years to—to create a complete and rounded human being, but
                    the writer hasn't got that much time. He's only got thirty minutes, or at the
                    best, three or four hours, and so probably any writer is—has made a
                    composite picture. It's—it's people he knew or things he imagined,
                    things he read, things he heard, but he wouldn't bother with trying to—to reduce
                    to paper or to put onto paper any living creature. Also, there's a—a 
                    quality of—of God-like omnipotence that the fury of—of
                    creating something gives you, and you're not satisfied with the way God did it.

                    deck of cards, that hadn't changed Miss Sophonsiba's intentions at all. And
                    probably Uncle Buck finally just gave up. That was his fate, and he—he

                <u who="WF">He very likely looted his Caribbean father-in-law's plantation when he
                    married the daughter. I don't know that I ever decided myself just how he did
                    it, but very likely he looted and wrecked—wrecked the whole place,
                    took—took the girl because he didn't want her especially. He wanted a
                    son. He wanted to establish his dynasty. And I imagine that—that he—he got
                    that money to the States and then had to hide it here and there. There were no
                    banks in those days, no safe place to put it. Probably was—was gold,
                    something that was intrinsic of itself, and he would go off wherever he had

                    that begins with the—with the—the thought, the image of a
                    character or of an anecdote and, even in the same breath, almost like lightning,
                    it—it begins to take a shape that he can see whether it's going to be
                    a short story or a novel. Sometimes, not always. Sometimes he thinks it'll be a
                    short story and finds that he can't. Sometimes it looks like it's to be a novel,
                    and then, after he works on it, he sees that it's not, that he can tell it in
                    two thousand or five thousands words. No rule to it.

                    it was moving. It—it was actually in motion. The last two or three
                    years, it has stopped and—and in ways, has retrograded. There was a
                    little too much pressure from outside. But there are—are people in the

                    situation as being intolerable, not from a humanitarian point of view, but from
                    a practical point of view, that a country cannot endure with a minority as big
                    as seventeen million people, second-rate citizens. It just—faced with
                    the—with the trouble that we face in the world,

                    should've been ceased sooner?</u>
                    <u who="WF">Well, it—the—the push carried on too long. If there'd been a nudge
                    and then, stop, and let the ball move of its own weight. But success goes to
                    anyone's head, and it creates its own illusion, and the people who had felt that
                    things were going too slow, that that's—anything that slow was not
                    progress, it was difficult to tell them to stop. You couldn't expect them to
                    stop. That that has— has done harm, but I think that will not really
                    delay equality for the Negro. It will cause a great deal of—of trouble
                    and anguish, and individuals will suffer, but I think the course of—of
                    the Negro's advancement in the South hasn't been hurt by this. I don't think
                    it's been helped very much by it, except that—that somebody somewhere
                    has got to nudge us now and then, that we do go too slow if it's left to
                    ourselves. People are too prone to say, "Oh, well, things are all right." Like the
                    sign in the Pullman Car that says, "Quiet is requested for the sake of those
                    who have already retired." That sort of thing, you know.

                    them. It's simply because as—as the writer grows old—I've heard other
                    writers say this, too, they read less and less. I don't know why that is,
                    but—but most writers, as they grow old, they seem to read less and
                    less. It's not that they're indifferent to their—to their juniors.
                    It's—it can't be any jealousy because I think that any sincere writer
                    has—has failed to do what he'd like to do. That is, it—it's
                    not better than was ever done before.  But he has enough belief in
                    his—in his craft, his—his avocation, to be convinced that
                    behind him someone is come—coming that will do it, that may do it. And
                    as I say, I—it's not because I—I don't like to read anymore. I simply
                    read less than I did. And when I do read, it's—it's when there's
                    nothing better to do, you might say, and so I'll pick up the book just to pass
                    time. When I was younger, I was an avid reader because I was learning. That was
                    the way I learned my craft. I read everything I could get my hands on to see how

                    about the critical process as being primarily an imaginative one, in which
                    you—you do not simply try to hold a mirror up to a particular
                    character in the scene, but in which your product is the product of your
                    imagination, which is in the background, the product of all that you've learned.
                    This, you—you've said, meant that—means that, if a writer sets a pattern
                    for himself and sees the pattern of the whole work, then his writing becomes
                    merely a matter of swatting it out. Does this mean, for example, that <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, in which the pattern was set, is to a
                    large extent, merely a matter of swatting it out, or that any man who, like
                    Spenser in the <hi rend="italic">Faerie Queen</hi>, conceives of an idea as the
                    objective, rather than the production of the mere product of imagination, does

                    within accepted or circumscribed limits, but not rigid limits. They're simply
                    circumscribed. That—that the imagination must be checked by <unclear>something</unclear><inaudible/> and
                    the pattern conform or—or meet or be amicable, we'll say, and when one
                    has to give, I believe it's always the pattern that has to give, and so he's got
                    to rewrite to create a new pattern with a <unclear>bulge</unclear> that will take
                    this—this <unclear>bulge</unclear> of the imagination which insists that it's true. It

                    toward a condition, it doesn't always make a great novel. It could maybe. It's
                    got to be an indignation at—at man's condition, not his—his
                    particular situation, but at his condition. It's something
                    that's—that's got to be strong enough to—to raise the steam,
                    to make the artist assume the anguish and trouble and travail of putting
                    something down on paper or in music or to paint it or to hack it out of a piece
                    of marble. That's—could be indignation, but it's—it's indignation at
                    man's condition, I believe, not at a—at a particular instance of
                    injustice or cowardice. That might be the germ in which an individual,
                    the—the conception of a man, the idea of an individual against

                    didn't create the—the individual. The individual is the—the

                <u who="B">I think you were speaking about the act of creation a while ago.
                    Sometimes we read that many authors seem to—to create with a—with a high degree of
                    objectivity, and that other authors have the feeling that when they're going
                    about this process, they are almost in the very act of experiencing, literally,
                    the things that—that their created people are experiencing. In some
                    of—of the people that you've created that you have enjoyed doing most,
                    or felt you hit off most truly, have you ever had the illusion, or the
                    feeling, that in the act of creation that the sensations were—you were
                    experiencing them almost as if this act were literally happening to you?</u>
                <u who="WF">Not exactly, because when my people come alive, they take charge of what
                    we're doing, and I'm going at a—a dead run to keep up and put down
                    what they do and say. I don't have time to—to think much about myself in this
                    business. I'm too busy trying to keep up with them, that they—they
                    talk and act too fast. I'm afraid that—that if I stop for a minute,
                    I'll miss something.  And I know that I can't invent it because they've taken
                    charge. They're doing the inventing by that time. I'm just the secretary by
                    then.

                    your very, very long sentences, but yet you say they're very carefully
                    contrived. Well, what do you do? Get down what comes out and then go back and
                    work over it?</u>
                <u who="WF">That's right.</u>
                    <u who="Q">Perfect it?</u>
                    <u who="WF">That's right. It's—I think that probably goes
                    back to the burden which man carries all his life, is the knowledge of 
                    death. That is, he knows that he won't live forever, and he's found something so
                    amazing and so moving, which is—is breathing or being—being
                    in the world, a part of it, and in a way he is attempting to write the whole
                    history of the human heart on the head of a pin, because he thinks he may not
                    last long enough to put it down on anything as big as a piece of paper. Also, I
                    think that a man at any moment of action is the living sum of his past,
                    that—and the reason for—for the long sentences that go so
                    far into the past and into the future is that belief, that man at the very
                    moment at which he is doing something, he did that particular thing exactly in
                    that way because of the hundred years before him that made him, and that's
                    simply a matter of trying to remind the reader that—that this man is—is
                    complete in motion, only because he is the sum of his ancestors and his
                    condition, his times.</u></div2>

                <u who="WF">Oh, yes, yes. I think any writer keeps at it until he knows that that's
                    the best he can do. It may not be good enough, but when he realized that's the
                    best he can do, then he moves on to the next sentence or the next paragraph.</u>
                <u who="Q">That's not exactly what I meant. I mean, you say you write as fast as you
                    can to get it out, and then you go back and build up the constructions in there and
                    —</u>

                    it in shape in my mind before I take the—do the work. I didn't mean
                    that I scribble and then went back over it and—and edit it, no.
                    It's—it's done as much as possible mentally, until it begins to sound

                    they're trying to give the public a picture of people. They're rather trying
                    to slap them in the face a little bit and paint in extremes.</u>

                        were the best tools. I—I think that—that—that Shaw
                    was—was trying to write about human beings in the—in the
                    light of his own intelligence and his own wit and his—his own distaste
                    for certain conditions. I think that Mencken was—was still
                        a—a—a constantly angry, indignant man, more—he was first that.
                    He was only second a critic or a sociologist. He was mainly just a mad man.

                    who wasted nothing, who was—whose approach toward his language was
                    almost the lapidary's, that he was—he—whether he had the
                    leisure, I—I don't know exactly for what the—what the term I
                    want—that is, a man who—who elected to do one book

                    didn't have much time to bother about style, and when he did attain style, he
                    was just as astonished as anybody else. Though that—that comparison, I
                    grant you, is—is better between Flaubert and Balzac, maybe. Well
