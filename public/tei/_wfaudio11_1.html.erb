<p><span class="speaker">Joseph Blotner</span> Well, we haven't heard from the agent, the

<p><span class="speaker">Engineer</span> Just a little bit there. If you can lean in, Mr. Faulkner, without

<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span> This is to remind us of our names. Wait a minute. I haven't got

<p><span class="speaker">Joseph Blotner</span> Yeah, you have.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span> But not&mdash;not&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Joseph Blotner</span> No.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span> Why don't you just turn it around?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Just write his name on a piece of paper and pin it to him. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some laughter happening">[laughter]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span> You did?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Joseph Blotner</span>He said, "And your announcer has been"&mdash;<span class="event tooltip" title="There was some laughter happening">[laughter]</span>. He

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>I can sit wherever you want me to.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Engineer</span>Well,that&mdash;that'll be fine. Just about like that. I think Mr. Hench

<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span>Does he want to try us out?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Engineer</span> Yes, sir.  In just a second.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span>Alright. Well, this is cheating, in a way, to do these two fifteen

<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>You just lie one thing after another, don't you?

<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>Mmhmm.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span>Well, how is this&mdash;how does this sound? Is that alright? And Mr.

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>If I know it, I will. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some laughter happening">[laughter]</span> You mean the rest of

<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span>Today as our special guest we have with us the American novelist
						William Faulkner, author-in-residence at the University of Virginia this
						semester. We are indeed fortunate to have him with us. Also around our table
						today are our regular panel members Mr. Edward Stephenson and Mr. Robert
						Davis. As&mdash;and, as another special panel member today, we have Mr. Joseph
						Blotner, of the English Department. And our subject today is Mr. Faulkner's
						dialect. And I suppose we might as well lay on the table one plain fact, one
						simple fact at first, that it is Mississippi dialect. Isn't it, Mr.
						Faulkner?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>As far as I know. I wouldn't limit it to Mississippi, though. I

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>I would say there are three. The&mdash;the dialect, the diction, of the

<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>May I come back for a moment to this distinction between the speech
						of the Negroes and of the&mdash;of what used to be called the poor white trash. In
						your short story "Wash," Mr. Faulkner, when Wash is talking about Colonel
						Sutpen, he call&mdash;you spell it K-E-R-N-E-L, when the Negroes are talking you
						spell it C-U-N-N-E-L. Is that supposed to be "Kernal' that Wash says, and
						"Cunnel" that the Negroes say. In other words, Negroes drop the "r."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>That's correct.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>That's the idea.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>That's correct. And the&mdash;what we call the redneck white man has a

<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>He has the&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>He says "fur" for far. He says "far" for fire.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>Yes.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>The Negro don't have the hard "r."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>I assumed that that was the purpose of that. Now if Colonel Sutpen

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>That's right, it's between&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>I'd like to make a point about the importance of knowing the
						author's speech in interpreting his dialect spellings. Now Thomas Nelson
						Page, for instance, when he wants to represent an Old Virginia Negro who
						says "cawn't," will spell that sometimes C-A-R-N-T. And I noticed you've done
						the same thing in "Wash." When the old Negro woman is talking to Colonel
						Sutpen, she says "Yes, mawster," and you spell it M-A-R-S-T-E-R. Now we
						should interpret that "mawster" rather than "master", but it isn't "marster,"
						is it?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>No.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>It's "moster." And the "ar" spelling then, since we know that you
						are from a part of the country&mdash;and you yourself drop the "r" after a vowel,
						then the "ar" can be a symbol for the sound "aw."</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Robert Davis</span>I suppose, Mr. Faulkner, that'd be the same thing as when Dilsey
						says, "winda," and you spell it W-I-N-D-E-R. That she says "winda," rather
						than "winder."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>That's right. There's no "r."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Robert Davis</span>But now the backwoodsman would say "winder."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>That's right.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Robert Davis</span>Wouldn't he?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>"Winder."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Robert Davis</span>"Winder."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>And then you'd have a problem because you'd have to spell it the
						same way if you wanted to represent it in dialect, wouldn't you? That'd be a
						problem for the author to worry about there.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>I should say, being a Mississippian, I would probably put two r's on
						it.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>That's what Page does, by the way&mdash;no not Page, but James Russell
						Lowell in his "Bigelow Papers" when he wants to represent&mdash;in certain parts
						of New England where they have a very hard "r," he puts two "r"'s. That's
						the same thing he does.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>I want to ask Mr. Faulkner&mdash;ask you Mr. Faulkner why once you spell
						the word dog D-A-W-G for Wash. It seems to me that I don't approve of that
						spelling. That doesn't really differentiate Wash from any of the other
						characters. Wouldn't they all say "dawg"? Don't you say "dawg"? Doesn't
						everybody in Mississippi say "dawg."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, the reason for that is that someone has said southerners don't
						read books; they write books. And I think that when the southerner writes
						deliberately spelled dialect, he is writing not for the man that calls "dog"
						"dawg," but for the man that calls "dog" "dog."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>But "dawg"&mdash;"dawg" is very general all over the country. Of course in
						some parts of the Midwest people do say "dog." But in New England and the
						South, and a large part of the rest of the country D-O-G is "dawg"</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, but these people would speak with a&mdash;even more flatness than
						that. It would be "Dawg."</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>Well another&mdash;another point I'd like to ask you about. In the use of
						"hit" which I'm familiar with in Georgia. It's an old form that's survived.
						But it seems to me, at least in Georgia, the distinction is this. In an
						unstressed, where the&mdash;where the syllable would not be accented&mdash;for instance,
						you could hardly say&mdash;if you wanted to say "Move it over thar," you&mdash;it would
						be hard say "move hit over thar." But if you said, "Hit don't make no
						difference"&mdash;or&mdash;when it's stressed, it would be "hit." But I notice you use it
						rather indiscriminately whether it would be in a stress position or not in a
						stress position. I think&mdash;I think you were careless in that regard.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Perhaps so, but I think I have heard it used&mdash;sometimes the same man
						will say "move hit yonder" or "move it yonder."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span>And "make it now" and "make hit now."</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>That's right, the same&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Atcheson Hench</span>More deliberation.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Well, I don't know. It's&mdash;he probably is not aware himself. At
						one time he puts an  and the next time he drops it.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Joseph Blotner</span>I should think his&mdash;the speed with which he spoke or the emotion&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, has a lot to do with it.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Joseph Blotner</span>That might even determine which spelling&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Edward Stephenson</span>For instance, here's one. Wash says, "You make hit right," and you
						spell it H-I-T, which&mdash;but again, he says, "Hit don't need no ticket."</p>
