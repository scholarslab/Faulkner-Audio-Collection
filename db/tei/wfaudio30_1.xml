                    <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, during our formal education we are—are taught to
                    adhere to certain grammatical rules, punctuation rules, sentence structure and
                    so forth. Do you think that if a writer attempts to adhere to such rules that
                    his style is restricted or cramped in any sense?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, sir. I don't think so. It may be that his opportunities for
                    experimentation are cramped. I think that—that any language must
                    continue to be alive. That is, it must continue to change or be susceptible to
                    change, and—and grammar, punctuation are—are part of that
                    fluidity. If by experimentation you—you find out if the old ways were
                    the best or maybe the old ways might be subject to change. I wouldn't say that
                    it restricts your style because style could be a part of the—the
                    fluidity of—of the change. Style, if it's a—like anything
                    else to be alive it must be in motion too. If it becomes fixed, then it's dead.
                    It's just rhetoric. The style must change according to what the writer is trying
                    to tell. What he is trying to tell, in fact, compels the style.

                    loud enough, would you let me know?<lb/>
                        Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, do you feel that the traditional values of the South have
                    been endangered by increased industrialization <inaudible/>?</u>
                <u who="WF">They couldn't be. The—the values of any thing, to be of any
                    importance, must be alive, too. It may be that you won't like to see
                    industrialization. You won't like to see the old customs change. But the only
                    alternative to change is—is to cease, to die. And I think
                    that—that any culture that's worth its salt is going to cope with any
                    change. That industrialization is not going to destroy anything of value in the
                    South. The things of value which are—are obsolete will be remembered,
                    and they will be the material for—for writing, for
                    art, even though they no longer exist as a—a motivating quality in the
                    present culture. They will exist as a—well,
                    the—the jeweled casket to hold the
                        fine traditions. In the sense that—that there's
                    no such thing as "was" really, that every man is—is the sum of his
                    past, of his ancestry, and so there's nothing ever ends in that sense. As long
                    as somebody remembers it, it still exists. The good of it will still exist,
                    still be available.

                    is there any redemption <unclear>within the Snopes family of itself?</unclear>
                    Will that come or is that going too far <unclear>into your next novel</unclear>?</u>
                <u who="WF">Possibly. I think that—that in time evil will—will
                    exhaust its own tools. That is, the—the Snopeses will vanish. There will
                    be some Snopeses named something else. <event desc="audience laughter"/> And
                    it's not really necessary to redeem Snopeses. Snopeses are an infinitesimal part
                    of the human race of man, and man is—is, I think, pretty good. That
                    he's—he's doing all right. That he can—can take on a tribe of
                    Snopeses and can get rid of them, and they will not have done any great harm to
                    the—to the record of man's endeavor. That they are not really
                    a—a problem. They are a problem of the moment. And there's always
                    someone that will—will cope with Snopeses or will—will
                    outlast Snopeses. The—the good, the people that are against what
                    Snopeses represent will last longer than the family of Snopeses will.

                    a—a lot of Mark Twain or something like that? <event desc="audience laughter"/></u>
                <u who="WF">That's a good question. That is, it's a question I'm—I'm happy
                    to try to answer. I think that—that humor is not influenced by what
                    anyone reads. It—it's a—an attitude of optimism toward man's
                    predicament. That if—if you take man's predicament, the dilemma, too
                    seriously, that's not too good for anybody. But if you are capable of seeing
                    that man with all his folly, all the—the harm <unclear>and the
                       shoddiness</unclear> he does, that even in his—at his worst, he
                    is capable of doing things in a comical way that he himself didn't intend to do.
                    I don't think you need to—to ape Mark Twain or—or Leacock or
                    any other humorist to write humor. It's a point of view toward man in his
                    dilemma, which is to me a very healthy point of view. If you can—can
                    laugh at what man does, then you agree that what he does is not going to endure
                    long enough to do a great deal of harm.

                    southern culture, will alter for the better. I—I believe that there
                    are enough people in the South that realize that whether the Negro is now
                    capable of equality with the white man, he will have to have the chance to try
                    to find out, simply because the Negro is also a human being. And there's no
                    position for a second class human being in a culture opposed to another
                    antipathetical culture as the world is today.

                    novelist by allowing Hollywood sometimes to do a bad job <inaudible/>?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, sir, not at all. I think the writer has done the best he could, the
                    best he possibly could with that book, that nothing done to that book later can
                    change it—change what he did and the—the movies can take

                    for—for any reason other than the belief that they're going to improve
                    on it, then they won't hurt it. If he's going to—when the book is
                    finished, and it is done the way he wants it done, then some movie picture
                    company says, "If you'll rewrite this to please us, then we'll give you money
                    for it," and he says, "All right, I will—I will rewrite this book before

                <u who="WF">Well, in my opinion, the South will have to pull itself by its own
                    bootstraps for the reason I just stated, that the only alternative to motion,
                    progress, is death. It's a condition which we have realized much further back
                    than 1954 was—was an impossible situation. Our forefathers that fought
                    the—the Civil War knew that. Mr. Jefferson knew that a hundred and
                    fifty years ago. There were people even before Mr. Jefferson that realized that
                    slavery was an—an impossible condition in this country that would have

                    pressure on.  But nobody knows when to let well enough alone, and if he could
                    just keep the constant, faint pressure and let be at that, he would serve his
                    purpose, but he gets too enthusiastic with changing overnight a—a

                <u who="Q">Speaking of the character of Gavin Stevens in the book, did you have a
                    real life figure that you based him on?</u>
                <u who="WF">I think a writer writes from three sources. One is his own personal
                    experience, which would include, of course, the books he reads, has read, his
                    observation, and his imagination. I doubt if he himself can say just how much of
                    each source he has drawn from for this particular page or story or book. I
                    believe, though, that he is convinced that he can create much better people than
                    God can. <event desc="audience laughter"/> That he will never be satisfied to
                    take anyone he has seen from real life, put into a book, because he would
                    improve on it. I think that maybe a writer is incapable of actually sticking to
                    the truth, that he is a congenital liar, and he is going to change, alter,
                    anything that he—he touches to put down on paper. So he himself can't
                    say just how much of the character he actually saw, how much he heard about, how
                    much he imagined. To him that's not too important. His—what he wants
                    to do is to create characters of his own, yet are so close to life, so
                    life-like, that the people that read the books will say, "Why yes,
                    that's—that man could be so. In fact, I know somebody a good deal like
                    him." Though, actually, the character that he put down is—is not what
                    he ever saw. He's added something to it.

                    that I have always kept myself an amateur. I've never thought of myself as a
                    professional. I've done this for fun, and it didn't really matter to me whether
                    anybody read it or not. Success is—is feminine, and quite often
                    if—if you—if you beg and plead, she scorns you. If you show

                    not to make money, nor to be famous, but because it was fun. It was something I
                    found to do that was the most fun of anything I'd tried yet. I never could quite
                    do it, and so I'd never be bored with it. That each time I finished a book it
                    wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, but I still had some more paper, so I'd
                    write another one tomorrow, and maybe that one would be. <event desc="audience laughter"/> If any of you think of being writers that's the

                    culture contains this symbolism which has been established and described by
                    the—the experts, the psychiatrists and psychologists, and since
                    the—one man writes from it, another reads from it, it's natural that
                    the symbolism should appear. And since the—well, in our case now, we
                    both read and write from a culture we call the culture of the Christian culture,
                    and naturally symbols will be identifiable because they are part of the very air
                    that both the writer and the reader have breathed through education, and the
                    experiences of being a child, of being taught to be a Christian child, or the
                    child of cultured parents. But I don't think the writer has got time to say "Now

                    may know this, cats were the first form of life on earth. They had tried to make
                    civilization work, to get rid of wars and poverty and pestilence, and it didn't
                    work, so they summoned all the wise cats to a congress, and they said that we

                    inferior southerners, regardless of what color they are. The problem now is of
                    whether the—the inferior, the uneducated southerner will wait that
                    long anymore. But I don't know of anything better to do than to alter our system
                    of education so that the best can get the best of education. I don't know of
                    anything else that will help us or save us.

                    <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, do you believe that—do you feel optimistic about
                    the enduring values in current American fiction by the younger writers, say
                    under forty-five?  Do you see any potential change in trends that will be <unclear>of
                        lasting literary value.</unclear></u>
                <u who="WF">I can't give a good answer because like my most writers as I get older I
                    read less and less. It's been a long time since I have read my coevals. But I'm
                    convinced that that is the strongest motivation in man, is to—to create,
                    to produce literature, music, art. That's most enduring thing he has created and
                    I think that nothing, not even the atom bomb, is going to stop him. I would say
                    that now the—the young writer is subject to that same pressure to
                    conform, to belong to something, which I spoke of. But I think
                    that—that by the time he is thirty, if he has a
                    first rate talent, he will have outgrown that. And I'm convinced that the good
                    work will still be produced. It's comforting for a lazy man
                    to say, "Well, I would have been a good artist, if I'd been born—if I
                    hadn't been so unlucky as to be born in this time." I think that's nonsense.
                    That the good man is going to produce no matter when he's born, what age he's in.
                    That he will use that age as his material just as—as a part of the
                    reservoirs of observation and experience. And that he will produce the work,
                    too, if he has the talent and works, that nothing will stop him. And
                    I—I used to think that talent was important. I think maybe all he
                    needs is ruthlessness, industry and insight. That is to—to throw away
                    anything that seems to him untruthful or shoddy, to work hard, to be always
                    curious as to know why man does what he does. I think that if the young writer
                    has those three qualities he can write.
