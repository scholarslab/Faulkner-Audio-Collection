					has consented to come and talk to us about "The Old Man." We've been talking
					about "The Old Man" for the last week and been discussing it&#x2014;its structure and
					its meaning and its techniques&#x2014;in isolation, unconnected with the work with
					which it was originally published in alternating chapters, The
						Wild Palms. Our questions to Mr. Faulkner will be completely
					unrehearsed and unscreened, according to your desire, and I think this is the
					first time that you've talked to a freshman class, and so it will be interesting
					to observe what emerges. Mr. Faulkner has consented to begin the meeting by
						reading the end of "The Old Man." Mr. Faulkner.</p>

					That was all, the convict told them. They left the
						sawmill fast, he had no time to buy food until they reached the next&#x2014;next
						landing. There he spent the whole sixteen dollars he had earned and they
						went on. The River was lower now, there was no doubt of it, and sixteen
						dollars' worth looked like a lot of food and he thought maybe it would do,
						would be enough. But maybe there was more current in the River still than it
						looked like. But this time it was Mississippi, it was cotton; the plow
						handles felt right to his palms again, the strain and squat of the thick 
						buttocks against the middle buster's blade was what he knew, even though
						they paid but a dollar a day here. But that did it. He told it: they told
						him it was Saturday again and paid him and he told about it&#x2014;night, a smoked
						lantern in a disc of worn and barren earth as smooth as silver, a circle of
						crouching figures, the importunate murmurs and ejaculations, the meagre
						piles of worn bills beneath the crouching knees, the dotted cubes clicking
						and scuttering in the dust; that did it. "How much did you win?" the second
						convict said. "Enough," the tall one said. 
				</p>

<div class="section">

  <p>
						"How much?"
							"Enough," the tall one said. It was
						enough exactly; he gave it all to the man who owned the second motor boat
						(he would not need food now), he and the woman in the launch now and the
						skiff towing behind it, the woman with the baby and the paper-wrapped parcel
						beneath his peaceful hand, on his lap; almost at once he recognised, not
						Vicksburg because he had never seen Vicksburg, but the trestle beneath which
						on his roaring wave of trees and houses and dead animals he had shot,
						accompanied by thunder and lightning, a month and three weeks ago; he looked
						at it once without heat, even without interest as the launch went on. But
						now he began to watch the bank, the levee. He didn't know how he would know
						but he knew he would, and then it was early afternoon and sure enough the
						moment came and he said to the launch owner: "I reckon this will do."

					 "Here?" the launch owner said. "This dont look like
						anywhere to me."
						"I reckon this is it," the convict said. So the launch put
						inshore, the engine ceased, it drifted up and lay against the levee and the
						owner cast the skiff loose.
						"You better let me take you on until we come to
						something," he said. "That was what I promised."
						"I reckon this will do,"
						the convict said. So they got out and he stood with the grapevine painter in
						his hand while the launch purred again and drew away, already curving; he
						did not watch it. He laid the bundle down and made the painter fast to a
						willow root and picked up the bundle and turned. He said no word, he mounted
						the levee, passing the mark, the tide-line of the old raging, dry now and
						lined, traversed by shallow and empty cracks like foolish and deprecatory
						senile grins, and entered a willow clump and removed the overalls and shirt
						they had given him in New Orleans and dropped them without even looking to
						see where they fell and opened the parcel and took out the other, the known,
						the desired, faded a little, stained and worn, but clean, recognisable, and
						put them on and returned to the skiff and took up the paddle. The woman was
						already in it.

					The plump convict stood blinking at him. "So you come
						back," he said. "Well well." Now they all watched the tall convict as he bit
						the end from the cigar neatly and with complete deliberation and spat it out
						and licked the bite smooth and damp and took a match from his pocket and
						examined the match for a moment as though to be sure it was a good one,
						worthy of the cigar perhaps, and raked it up his thigh with the same
						deliberation&#x2014;a motion almost too slow to set fire to it, it would seem&#x2014;and
						held it until the flame burned clear and free of sulphur, then he put it to the
						cigar. The plump one watched him, blinking rapidly and steadily. "And they
						give you ten years more for running. That's bad. A fellow can get used to
						what they give him at first, to start off with, I dont care how much it is,
						even a hundred and ninety-nine years. But ten more years. Ten years more, on
						top of that. When you never expected it. Ten more years to have to do
						without no society, no female companionship&#x2014;" He blinked steadily at the
						tall convict. But he (the tall convict) had thought of that too. He had had
						a sweetheart. That is, he had gone to church singings and picnics with her&#x2014;a
						girl a year or so younger than he, short-legged, with ripe breasts and a
						heavy mouth and dull eyes like ripe muscadines, who owned a baking-powder
						can almost full of ear-rings and brooches and rings bought (or presented at
						suggestion) from ten-cent stores. Presently he had divulged his plan to her,
						and there were times later when, musing, the thought occurred to him that
						perhaps if it had not been for her he would not actually have attempted 
						it&#x2014;this a mere feeling, unworded, since he could not have phrased this either:
						that who to know what Capone's uncandled bridehood she might not have
						dreamed to be her destined fate, what fast car filled with authentic
						colored glass and machine guns, running traffic lights. But that was all
						past and done when the notion first occurred to him, and in the third month
						of his incarceration she came to see him. She wore ear-rings and a bracelet
						or so which he had never seen before and it never became quite clear how she
						had got that far from home, and she cried violently for the first three
						minutes though presently (and without his ever knowing either exactly how
						they had got separated or how she had made the acquaintance) he saw her in
						animated conversation with one of the guards. But she kissed him before she
						left that evening and said she would return the first chance she got,
						clinging to him, sweating a little, smelling of scent and soft young female
						flesh, slightly pneumatic. But she didn't come back though he continued to
						write to her, and seven months later he got an answer. It was a postcard, a
						colored lithograph of a Birmingham hotel, with a childish X inked heavily across
						one window, the heavy writing on the reverse slanted and primer-like too:
							This is where were honnymonning at. Your friend (Mrs)
							Vernon Waldrip

					 The plump convict stood blinking at the tall one,
						rapidly and steadily. "Yes, sir," he said. "It's them ten more years that
						hurt. Ten more years to do without a woman, no woman a tall a fellow wants&#x2014;"
						He blinked steadily and rapidly, watching the tall one. The other did not
						move, jackknifed backward between the two bunks, grave and clean, the cigar
						burning smoothly and richly in his clean steady hand, the smoke wreathing
						upward across his face saturnine, humorless, and calm. "Ten more years&#x2014;"
						"Women 'blank'!" the tall convict said.

  <p>If I may ask a question pursuing
					this idea. I believe that earlier in your life that you did quite a bit of
					traveling and had a lot of experiences as an apprentice seaman, I believe, and
					flying. Do you think that&#x2014;to any author or even more generally, to anyone who
					wants to formulate ideas about life and all, do you think that this is very
						valuable while younger to travel around and not be fixed down, or&#x2014;?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio16_1.12"/>
  <p>Yes, sir.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio16_1.13"/>
  <p>It seems to me in reading the book
					that he was depending a lot on fate to lead his life&#x2014;that he would be led by
						fate as much as religion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio16_1.14"/>
  <p>Well, when he got back, sir, did
					he share this view with the others that it was ten years without women&#x2014;I mean,
					do you think he minded this?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio16_1.15"/>

  <p>Do you think he would have stayed

  <p>And when you reached the point

  <p>Yes, sir.</p>

  <p>Did the tall convict have any

</div>
<div class="section">
  <a name="wfaudio16_1.26"/>
  <p>In the book, you had elaborated to
					some extent on the fact that the Old&#x2014;the Old Man was fruitful and life-giving
					and such, and what it was to farmers and just to the people who lived along the
					Mississippi, and to&#x2014;to that area. It&#x2014;it was fruitful and not a destructive
					force.</p>
