                    which was a stream, which up to that time had been flowing toward the river.
                    This wave of water from the—at that time the river, the Mississippi,
                    was—was forty feet higher than the country, and when that levee gave
                    way, that—that mass of water that came through had to go somewhere,
                    and it broke on the east side of the river, so that wave of water simply
                    continued to go east until it spent itself, and in this—this stream,
                    which up till that time had been flowing placidly west, it turned around and ran
                    backward. That's just a physical fact of—of hydraulics and
                        levee.

                    you're talking about, but I noticed we're missing this Mississippi accent which
                    is so prevalent in those people. You made no attempt to
                    simulate that in the dialect. Is there any reason for that?</u>
                <u who="WF">If the writer puts too much attention to transcribing literally
                    the—the dialogue he hears, it's confusing to people who have never
                    heard that speech. That is, some—some of the words are difficult to
                    spell. They would be—to a Mississippian, he would see the words
                    spelled the way a Mississippian would spell it, he would know how it sounded,
                    but to an outlander, he wouldn't know. He would mispronounce that word wrong.
                    You can—can go only so far with—with dialect, and then
                    there's a point where for—for the simple reason not to make too much
                    demand on the writer, to distract his attention from the story you're telling,
                    you've got to draw the line.

                        It makes a good writer. Do you believe that Thomas Wolfe
                    uses a lot of imagination in his writing, or do you think that he just wrote 
                    primarily from experience?</u>
                <u who="WF">I think that no writer writes primarily from experience or observation
                    or imagination. It's as though he has three tanks with three lines and maybe a
                    mixing valve, and he draws from that tap, from all three of them, and he himself
                    can never say how much of this was imagination, how much was observation, how
                    much was experience. He—he couldn't and then he—he wouldn't
                    bother to because that's not too important. If what he tells seems real and
                    seems true, then how much of what came from where and when makes no difference
                    to him.

                    let the novel carry itself as you go along?</u>
                <u who="WF">Sometimes there is a—a general idea of what the end might be.
                    That is, an anecdote or a scene, or it could be a scene at the—at the
                    first—first of the book, or I don't know until I start where the scene
                    might come. It could begin with a character, or it could begin with
                    a—with an idea—an idea out of man's condition. That is, in <hi rend="italic">Absalom, 
                        Absalom!</hi>—that began with the idea of a man that
                    wanted—a ruthless man that wanted a son and got so many that they
                    destroyed one another and destroyed him, but the idea almost at once produced
                    the protagonist, which was the man himself. Some writers, I think, have to have a
                    plot. They—they do research. They have notebooks and graphs and charts
                    and things, but I never have worked that way. Mine begin with—with a—a 
                    scene or an anecdote to write toward, or with a character, and after the
                    characters, the people come alive, then all the writer has to do is to trot
                    along beside them with a notebook and a pencil, and put down what they say and
                    do. Of course, at the end, you've got to—to use some discipline, to do
                    editing, to pick and choose and make the—give the whole thing
                    coherence and emphasis at the right place and unity, but with me, the characters
                    take charge of the story, and all I have to do is just put down what they do and
                        say.

                    story. That he—there's one thing in man's condition that seems to him
                    the most moving, the most tragic, and this time Hemingway was writing the story
                    which still seemed to him moving and tragic, which like all writers he never had
                    told well enough to please him. This one was brought into urgency by
                    the—the condition <event desc="gap in tape"/>, that he was not really
                    writing primarily about the Spanish Civil War, but he was writing about
                    the—the human condition, which to him was moving and tragic in the
                    terms of that war.

                    whether it's an urge, it's difficult to say, but he is driven by a demon, that
                    he has found this world amazing and—and disturbing or tragic or comic
                    or anyway passionate enough, so that he has got to use the time he's on earth
                    to express maybe his appreciation of the fact that he lived for a little while.
                    Maybe he's in a way saying, "Much obliged God that I was here for a while."

                    but he would—he would never make that aberration again, and 
                    he—the—he—the reason for the security he wanted was that he would never

                    like that, but he wasn't too sure. He knew as long as he was in

                    did something wrong, he knew that, and he was expiating his crime. He was
                    doing the best he could to lead a decent life while he was there, to expiate his
                    crime against society. He had a—a standard of morals, and that was, I
                    think, his strength. He had been sent out to—to rescue two people in a
                    flood, and he did the best he could to rescue both of them and bring them back.
                    That took a certain sort of morality to do that. He could have escaped at any

                    that—that the young man or young woman that wants to write will have
                    to make that choice. He has got to decide, "Do I want to do this because
                    I have a demon that won't let me alone or do I want to make some money at this?"
                    I think, in the case of—of the men and women who have been the good
                    writers, that choice never occurred to them, that they had never had to stop to
                    decide, "I—I have a choice to make, now, which shall I choose," because
                    he has made that choice. The alternative has never occurred to him, any more

                    wants to be a banker, he will be a banker, but he will be a writer, too. If he
                    wants to be a doctor, he will be a doctor, but if he has a demon to write he
                    will still be a writer, too. He will find plenty of time to be a writer, be a
