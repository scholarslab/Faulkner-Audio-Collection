                    <u who="M">I think I'll take the moderator's <unclear>privilege and ask the
                        first question,</unclear> if I may. I'd like to know a little bit about the
                    circumstances of the composition of "The Bear." Can you remember when it was
                    that you first thought of it and put it down <inaudible/>?</u>
                <u who="WF">I couldn't—couldn't say. That story is probably a summation
                    of—of my whole experience from the first time I was big enough to go
                    into the woods where bears were with a gun until I became a man.
                    Probably—that story may be autobiographical, in the sense that it was
                    that little boy's confrontation with something big and important, for he himself
                    to find how he would meet it, to—as Hemingway says, "to meet it with
                    grace." What I mean is, probably I was composing that story from the first
                    moment I went into the—what we call the big woods and—and realized
                    what it was. There would be bigger animals, wilder animals than the rabbits and
                    possums and things that I had experience with when I was not big enough yet to
                    carry a gun into the woods.</u>
                <u who="Q">You really began composing it when you were Isaac's age?</u>
                <u who="WF">I think so, yes, or remembered it, and then when I had acquired some
                    skill in the craft of writing, to write my own biography against something
                    which was a—a fine pleasure to me, a worthwhile pursuit, which is
                    probably a part of any boy's life, any American boy, unless he has—was
                    bred and lived all his life in the city. I imagine there are not many of you here
                    who haven't hunted. When you first have a gun, rabbits, possums, and then you
                    got big enough to hunt bigger game than that.</u></div2>

                    I—I believe I have used him. But he hasn't been the central character

                    <head>Meaning of the Hunt</head>
                    <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, since you put such meaning into the hunt, could you tell us
                    just why you hunted when you were a young boy or—or what meaning the
                    hunt has to you?</u>
                <u who="WF">The hunt was simply a—a symbol of pursuit. Most
                    of—of anyone's life is a pursuit of something. That is, the only
                    alternative to life is immobility, which is death. This was a—a
                    symbolization of the pursuit which is a normal part of—of anyone's
                    life while he stays alive, told in terms which were familiar to me
                    and—and dramatic to me. The protagonist could have been anything else
                    beside that bear. I simply told a story which was a—a natural, normal
                    part of anyone's life in a familiar and, to me, interesting terms, without any
                    deliberate intent to put symbolism in it. I was simply telling something which
                    was, in this case, the child, the—the need, the compulsion of the
                    child to adjust to the adult world. It's how he does it, how he survives it,
                    whether he is destroyed by trying to adjust to the adult world or whether,
                    despite his small size, he does adjust within his capacity. And always to learn
                    something, to learn something of—not only to pursue but
                    to—to overtake and then to have the compassion not to
                    destroy. To—to catch, to touch, and then let go
                    because then tomorrow you can pursue again. If you destroy what you caught, then
                    it's gone. It's finished. And that, to me, is—is sometimes the greater
                    part of valor, but always it's the greater part of pleasure, not to destroy what
                    you have pursued. The pursuit is the—is the thing, not the reward, not
                    the—the gain.

                <u who="WF">No—well, if—if it—if it should, it would
                    not be, maybe, as strong as Ike's. I think that any author
                    should—should put on the—a full page in his book that he is
                    not responsible for the ideas expressed by any of his characters, their ideas or
                    political convictions or—or religious beliefs.  I—I think that Ike probably carried
                    that a little further than—than I might have because it was necessary
                    for my story that he should.  That he was a—he was a poet, in his way,
                    an idealist, which I probably am not or, anyway, not as good a one as
                        Ike.

                <u who="WF">Well, he didn't acknowledge Bon for the reason that—that Bon
                    was part Negro. To have acknowledged Bon as his son would have destroyed the
                    very dream, the drive, which had compelled him to go through hardship
                    and—and suffering to begin with. He couldn't acknowledge Bon as his
                    son.</u>
                <u who="Q">Did he acknowledge Clytemnestra as his daughter?</u>
                <u who="WF">No. Well, that would not have mattered because Clytemnestra was a
                    female. The important thing to him was he should establish a line of dukes, you
                    see. He was going to create a dukedom. He'd have to have a male descendent. He
                    would have to establish a dukedom, which would be his revenge on the white
                    Virginian who told him to go to the back door. And so
                    he—he—to have a Negro—half-Negro for his son
                    would have wrecked the whole dream, so he couldn't. If he had thought
                    that—that it would ever be exposed that Bon was his son, he may have
                    killed Bon himself. If it'd ever come to that point, he would destroy Bon, just
                    as he would destroy any other individual that got in his way.</u></div2>

                <u who="WF">I think that's a license that the writer should be permitted. He
                    is—is trying to—to take an instant in man's struggle within
                    the—the human dilemma and isolate it in some dramatic form, and he
                    hasn't got the time to do it that—that living people
                    would—would have. They would have days and weeks to tell this story,
                    but he has got to tell it in thirty minutes or two or three hours or, at most,
                    two days. He has got to emphasize, over-emphasize at times. He's got to
                    under-emphasize at others.  So that is his—the privilege of his craft
                    to—to put a sort of poetry into the mouths of people that in—<unclear>you're

                    So at what point

                <u who="WF">I think that Bon knew all the time that—that his mother was
                    part Negress, but during Bon's childhood that was not important. He grew up
                    in—in the Indies and New Orleans where that wasn't too important. His
                    mother was a wealthy woman. She could have called herself a Creole, whether she
                    had Negro blood along with the French or not. It became important only when Bon
                    realized that it was important to his father. I think that Bon got into that
                    business—well, of course, because he formed a friendship with Henry
                    and felt that he—that Henry, the—the ignorant country boy
                    had given him a sort of worship, an admiration and a worship,
                    which—which he enjoyed. Then when he saw the sort of stiff-necked man
                    that Henry's father was and knew that that was his father too, he, in a way, had
                    given his father a chance to say, "I will acknowledge you, but if
                    you—if I do <inaudible/> <unclear>here</unclear>  you will wreck what I have devoted my life to and
                    so take my love and go," I think Bon would have done, but this old man was
                    afraid to do that. And Bon tempted him, to hold him over the coals in
                    partly—in revenge on his treatment of his—Bon's mother,
                    until Bon got involved too deeply. No, Bon knew that he was a Negro, but until
                    he found it was important to Sutpen, that wasn't important to him, that he was
                    a—a gentleman, had been well bred, cultured, much better bred and
                    cultured than Henry himself was.

                    So—so these are—are true as far as—as Miss Rosa

                    Quentin, who appears in <hi rend="italic">The Sound and the Fury</hi>, that is a
                    man thinking about his own Compson family, his own sister?</u>
                <u who="WF">To me he's consistent, that he approached the Sutpen family
                    with—with the same ophthalmia that he approached his own troubles,
                    that he probably never saw anything very clearly, that his was just one of the
                    thirteen ways to look at Sutpen, and his may have been the—one of the
                    most erroneous. Probably his friend, McCannon, had a much clearer picture of
                    Sutpen from what Quentin told him than Quentin himself would.</u></div2>

                    actually telling his biography. That's all anyone ever does, tells his own

                    be justified by acquiring property. She was, ethically, a prostitute. Sexually
                    she was frigid. I think what he meant—he knew that—that
                    there was no warmth that he would ever find from her, no understanding,
                    no—no chance ever to—to accept love or return love because
                    she was incapable of it. That's probably what he meant.</u>
