                    the work. It's much better to show the character in familiar terms
                    of—of action, of speech, but sometimes that's not sufficient. Then you
                    have to use another tool, just as at times the carpenter realizes that his
                    familiar tool is not quite enough to do what he wants to do, so he's got to stop

                <u who="Q">The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> spoke of your
                    brooding concern for people. This—were you born with that brooding

                <u who="WF">Now, I think that's a question you should ask the man who wrote the

                    something that one doesn't need to brood about. People are interesting. They are
                    the—the most interesting, diverting thing on earth.
                    It's—it's fun to—to watch people and wonder why they do
                    what they do, not to brood over them. Of course, one has got to be concerned
                    over man's condition because if—if man is to advance, he must take
                    cognizance of man's condition to improve it, but you don't brood over it. You do
                    something about it. When you see injustice, you raise your voice
                    and—and state that "This is—this is bad, I don't like it," but
                    you don't brood over it.

                    <head>Simplicity v Complexity</head>
                    <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Sir, why is it that most of your short stories and hunting stories are so
                    clear and simple like the one you just read, yet—yet some of your
                    novels that you think are your finest, are, you know, <unclear>have</unclear> to
                    be so mixed up psychologically in that they're hard for the average reader to—to
                    understand?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, that is something like the first question we had. The story
                    commands its own method of telling it. Some stories can be told quite simply and
                    objectively, like this little boy's reactions to the adult world that he had to
                    cope with. Other stories demand more probing into what makes men and women tick.
                    That is, this little boy could show—could show what made him tick by
                    his simple speech and actions. There are other times when the action and the
                    speech won't show that, so the craftsman's got to dig around to find some other
                    method to use to—to show what he hopes to tell. And it's not
                    that—that the ones I like are the ones in which I've done
                    the—in which I'm obscure. They're the—they're the ones that
                    have caused me the most trouble. I think none of the books that any writer does
                    are quite good enough. That's why he writes another one. The ones that he labors
                    the hardest over or worries the most about, he develops this—the same
                    affection for that the parent does for the—for the
                    unfortunate child, the sick child, or the—the mentally unbalanced
                    child, but they—they all are failures in his opinion because they're
                    not as good. He don't want to be as good as his—his coevals or even
                    just as good as Shakespeare. He wants to be better than Shakespeare and Homer.
                    He knows he can't, but that's—that's what he works for. That's what
                    makes a—a writer's life such a happy one. He always has something to
                    get up tomorrow that he's anxious to do, which is to—to attain the
                    impossible, never to—to reach satiety, always to have
                    something a little beyond his reach but still to jump at it, to try for it.</u></div2>

                    boy of nine seemed to have the future weight of the world on his

                <u who="WF">Well, I suspect that—that to any mother, the child is a genius
                    no matter what he does, <unclear>and I suspect</unclear>

                    is—is not much of anything to him and never will be, but I think that
                    probably the writer is—is being a writer from the time he begins to
                    observe long before he learns to spell. It's—sometimes a man or woman
                    begins to write at an early age. Sometimes they wait until middle age or even
                    late in life.</u>
                    <u who="Q">Well, did you write very early?</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes, but not seriously. I never thought of taking up writing as
                    a—a serious trade until I—I met Mr. Sherwood Anderson in New
                    Orleans, and I liked him at once. We would meet in the afternoon. I
                    had a—had other jobs then, but I would be <unclear>off at</unclear>
                    times, and we would walk down <unclear>in</unclear> New Orleans, and he would
                    talk, and I would listen. We would meet in the evening and go to a—a
                    courtyard, and—and he would talk, and I would listen until twelve or
                    one o'clock over a bottle of whiskey. The next morning he would be in seclusion
                    working. I wouldn't see him until afternoon, and then we would walk, and I would
                    listen, and he would talk, and we would talk and laugh again in the evening, and
                    the next morning he'd still be  writing. And I thought that if that's the
                    sort of life being a writer was then that's the life for me, <event desc="audience laughter"/> that I would become a writer. And so I started
                    writing a book and after the first page or two, I found it was fun, and I was at
                    it every day, and I hadn't seen Mr. Anderson in three or four weeks, and I met
                    Mrs. Anderson on the street one day. She said, "We haven't seen you in a long
                    time. What's wrong? Are you mad at us?" I said, "No, ma'am, I'm writing a book."
                        <event desc="audience laughter"/> And she said, "Good Lord." <event desc="audience laughter"/> I saw her later, and she said, "I told Sherwood
                    you were writing a book. He said, 'Do you want him to read it?'" I hadn't
                    thought of anybody reading it. I said, "Well'm, if he wants to, he can." She said,
                    "Well, he told me he would make a trade with you. If he don't have to read that
                    manuscript, he'll tell his publisher to take it." I said, "Done." <event desc="audience laughter"/> And so he told his publisher to take it. That's

                <u who="WF">In my case, there's never been any pressure. Never—never been
                    any pressure at all. I have written manuscripts which—which before
                    they were—were done, I myself decided were not good enough, and I
                    burned them up. There have been other manuscripts which I would send to the
                    publisher, and he'd say for a certain reason, "We can't print this," so I would
                    keep it until times changed, and then he'd say, "We can print them now <unclear>or
                        something like that</unclear>," but there're never been any pressure on me.
                    I—I've either had the best publishers or maybe some providence watched
                    over me and kept me from—from getting into trouble, but there's never
                    been any pressure on me, and I think that is—is what makes

                <u who="Q">I saw something not long ago that took <hi rend="italic">The Sound and
                        the Fury</hi>
                    <unclear>in the</unclear> four sections and tried to draw a parallel between the id

                    <unclear>not only</unclear> you but with contemporary writers, making psychological inferences and
                    finding symbols that the author never intended?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, I would say that the author didn't deliberately intend, but I
                    think that—that in the same culture, the background
                    of—of—of the critic and of the writer are so similar that a
                    part of—of each one's history is the—the seed, which can be
                    translated into the symbols which are standardized within that culture. That
                    is, the writer don't have to know Freud to have—have written things
                    which anyone who does know Freud can divine and reduce into—to
                    symbols. And so when the critic finds those symbols, they are, of course, there.
                    But they were there as—as—as inevitably as the critic
                    should—should stumble on his own knowledge of Freud to discern the
                    symbol. But I think the writer is primarily concerned in telling about people,
                    in the only terms he knows, which is out of his experience, his observation, and
                    his imagination. And the experience and the imagination and the observation of a
                    culture are—are all the people in that culture partake of it, of the
                    same three things, more or less. The—the critic has a—a
                    valid part in any culture. I think that it's—it might be a good thing
                    if most writers were like me and didn't bother to read him. That is, the writer
                    knows what is in his book, and he knows whether it—it failed or didn't
                    fail. The—and so it's possible that—that reading the
                    criticisms could do a young writer harm because it could confuse him.  It could
                    be—get him to think in terms of the symbolism which the critic, who is usually a
                    good deal more erudite than the writer, can find in his work.</u></div2>

                    incomprehensibility of the novels to the average reader, I will confess it took
                    a little more than three years to read <hi rend="italic">The Sound and the

                        really stronger than I could—could take all at once, and I wondered how long it took
                    you to write <unclear>this</unclear>.</u>
                <u who="WF">It didn't take too long to write it. It started out as a short story and
                    then grew. The—the obscurity in a writer's work is the—is
                    the writer's fault. It comes from a vali—very valid reason to him.
                    It's the sense, the foreknowledge of death which everyone has. The writer
                    has—has been stricken with the—the passion and beauty of
                    life, the world, and a—a demon-driven need to—to express
                    that, to put it down on paper or cut it into marble or into music, and with that
                    foreknowledge that he has only a limited time to do it, he may be dead 
                    tomorrow—he's got to do it all while he can still breathe, and it's a—a desire,
                    a need, to put the whole history of the human heart into any and every word,
                    every paragraph that he writes, and the obscurity comes from a belief which I
                    hold, that—that there is no such thing as "was."  That is that every man
                    at any moment in any action of his life is the sum of his whole past, and
                    to—to show that man in a book or story intact and whole,
                        <unclear>all</unclear> the long thread of his past has got to be implied or
                    inferred or suggested, and I haven't yet found any simple method to do that. The
                    obscurity is not deliberate. I hate that obscurity as much as any reader, but I

                    like that and have anybody believe it. But it's a slow

                    that people think of it, I think that—that equality for the Negro will
                    come. I think if the Negro has political equality to vote, if he has economic
                    equality, if he has educational equality, then he won't want to mix with white
                    folks any more than white folks wanted to mix him, because I can't imagine any

                    close to them. <event desc="audience laughter"/> But he has—he will
                    get equality. If it's given to him by a Supreme Court ukase and enforced with
                    police, as soon as the police are gone then some smart white man or even smart
                    Negro will take his equality away from him again. He has got to be taught the
                    responsibility of equality. That the—that the Constitution never said
                    everybody is to have happiness. They want to have—have the right to
                    gain happiness, if they could, and—and happiness or freedom is
                    something that you've got to work for. If it—if it were not to be
                    worked for it wouldn't be worth having. It's got to be worked for and defended.
                    Who was the Irish Member of Parliament who said, "Man—God hath

                    condition if he break it, servitude is the consequence of his crime, the
                    punishment of his guilt"? Well, that's true of anyone. You can't have freedom
                    unless you deserve it and work to keep it. That's—and equality, of

                    from that method. It—it suited him. He handled it well. If his work
                    continues, then it's going to get better. His last book, I think, <hi rend="italic">The Old Man and the Sea</hi>, was—was the best
                    because he discovered something which he had never found before, which was God.

                <u who="WF">Steinbeck to me has probably not done his best work. So far, he's a
                    better reporter than he is a—a novelist. And I think maybe
                    his—his best work is still to come.</u></div2>

                    open the book in the middle and read for a little while, and I imagine over the

                    <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner—</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Are these books then indicative of the authors who have written them, and
                    people who have had the most influence on you as a writer?</u>
                <u who="WF">I think that—that any writer is influenced by every word he
                    ever read in his life, from the telephone book up and down, <event desc="audience laughter"/> that he himself cannot say what book influenced
                    him at what time. It may be if he went back over his work, he could pick out
                    pages, scenes, and could see the derivation, but he never has time to do that
                    because by that time he's busy writing another book. Actually, as I've
                    said—said before, one virtue in being a writer is that every time you
                    finish a book, that's one book you'll never have to read. <event desc="audience laughter"/> You're finished with that one. But I'm sure that
                    any writer is influenced by everything that he has read, by everything he has
                    seen. He is completely amoral. He will take what he needs from any source, but
                    then he is willing to reciprocate, that anyone after him can take what they find
                    in his work that they can use, <event desc="audience laughter"/> but he'll have
                    no compunction about stealing right and left. Not deliberately, but
                    he's—it's his storehouse, and when he needs it, he uses it.</u>
                <u who="Q">This pertains then to both ideas and techniques of writing?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, ideas in the sense of learning how people behave. I think
                    that—that he doesn't bother about taking the abstract ideas of other
                    writers, because unless that abstract idea fits some character which he himself
                    feels that he's invented, then he will take it, but—but the fiction
                    writer is not too interested in ideas any more than he's very interested in
                    facts.  That he's interested in people and—and in man and
                    his—the infinite variety of his mutations and his struggles and
                    comical errors and tragic mistakes and his successes, his hopes.  Not in his
                    ideas, but in his eternal conflict with himself, with his fellows, or with his
                    environment. That's what the—the fiction writer's writing about. It
                    takes a philosopher to write about ideas, and most writers have been so busy
                    scribbling from childhood that they never had time to get much schooling to know
                    much about ideas.</u></div2>

                    ever—ever read. But I don't think that as long as the writer

                    where culture stopped and where it didn't stop. That he's not really interested
                    in culture or even interested in literature, until he writes himself out, and he
                    has been corrupted by—by books so much that he has nothing else to do
                    with his time save to take up being a literary man. Most writers are not

                <u who="WF">That would probably be the worst day the writer ever—ever
