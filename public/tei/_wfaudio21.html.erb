  <p><strong>Frederick Gwynn:</strong> and as we get into the final month, he's answered a good many
                    questions. About the only one he hasn't heard that's familiar to all teachers
                    is, "Will that be on the examination?" Mr. Faulkner's by now an old member of the
                    English Department, <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[although we did not accord him]</span> with the <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[title]</span> of professor we can
                    ask him almost&#x2014;we can ask him a lot more things than we can ask
                    professors, so now's our chance.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.2">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, one of your novels, <em>Requiem for a
                        Nun,</em> has been adapted to the theater and was successfully presented in
                    Paris and England. Do you feel others of your works might be successfully
                    dramatized, too, and do you plan to do it?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I&#x2014;I don't know. I don't know too much about theater. I wrote that book as
                        a play. It wasn't adapted. There were sections of it&#x2014;it&#x2014;the story fell into three
                        acts told in dramatic form. It was&#x2014;I&#x2014;I think played that way. There
                    were no adaptations and no changes. Of course, there may have been some changes
                    when Albert Camus got hold of it in Paris. He turned it into an existentialist
                    job, but he didn't change it too much. I think the&#x2014;the version
                    in&#x2014;in London was about as I wrote it, but it was&#x2014;was written
                    in that form. I felt, at the time, that that was the most effective way to tell
                    the story I was trying to tell. I think that's one of the tools of
                    the writer's craft, that he is at liberty to use whatever method
                    he thinks does the job best.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.3">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, Romain Gary wrote recently that he refuses to write only
                    from his own experience because it limits one so. Do you believe that it's
                    possible for&#x2014;for good fiction to be written by a novelist who attempts to write of
                    things beyond the limits of his own experience?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Oh, yes. Of course, you've got to define what you mean by experience. If
                    you restrict experience to what you yourself have&#x2014;have done, that
                    is a&#x2014;a limited field, and you would have only a limited field to
                    write from. To&#x2014;to me, experience is&#x2014;is anything that you
                    have perceived. It can come from&#x2014;from books.  A book that&#x2014;a
                    story that is&#x2014;is true enough and alive enough to move you, that, in my
                    opinion, is&#x2014;is your experience, is one of your experiences. You need
                    not to do the&#x2014;the actions that the people in that book do, but if they
                    strike you as being true, that they are things that people would do, that you
                    can understand the feeling behind them that made them do that, then that's an
                    experience to me. And so, in my definition of experience, you&#x2014;it's
                    impossible to write anything that is not an experience, because everything you
                    have&#x2014;have read, have heard, have sensed, have imagined is a part of
                    experience. That is, I think, there's as much of memory in the&#x2014;the nerves
                    and the muscles as there is in the gray matter.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.4">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I have a question Mr. Faulkner, sort of along these lines. It's a little
                    long, <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[yet]</span> I hope you'll bear with me.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir. Go slow with it <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[so I won't miss it]</span>.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I certainly will. As background on it, Mr. Gwynn asked us to&#x2014;to
                    write an outline of a novel that we wanted to write last semester. It was quite
                    a difficult task, for me at any rate, and here it is the question which comes
                    out of that attempt to write that outline. I sometimes think that the writer who
                    tells the truth has an almost insurmountable problem. First, he must know what
                    and how other people think, and second he must record what he knows in his artistic
                    creation. If you agree with this premise, which part of the writer's task is
                    the more difficult: knowing a character, that is what he believes and how he
                    reacts to the situations and so forth, or once you know it, getting it down on
                    paper?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Now there's another case where we've got to define terms. In my opinion,
                    truth don't have very much relation to facts, that some things you imagine or
                    you hear, you know is true. Maybe it ain't so, but it should be so. That to me
                    is truth. Now, give me the second half of your question again.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Well, the second half, as&#x2014;as I look at the problem of writing the novel is,
                    once you have your character in <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[mind]</span>, then getting him down
                    on paper, telling about the character, describing his thoughts or his opinions
                        or how he reacts under pressure or his philosophy, is getting that down&#x2014;that's
                    the, I suppose, the mechanical part.  Now what to me is, first, you
                    know your character, and you know what he's like. You know him, and then you
                    have to put him down on&#x2014;on the paper as you're writing, and I was
                    wondering if that is the sort of the way you approach a novel, which it probably
                    is not, but if it is, which would you say is&#x2014;is the hardest of the two
                        problems: to&#x2014;to get your character in your mind or to get him down on paper once
                    you have him in your mind?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I would say to get the character in your mind. Once he is in your mind,
                    and he is right, and he's true, then he does the work himself. All you need to
                    do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says.
                    It's the&#x2014;the ingestion and then the gestation. You've got to know the
                    character. You've got to believe in him. You've got to&#x2014;to feel
                    that&#x2014;that what&#x2014;that he is&#x2014;is alive, and then, of
                    course, you will have to do a certain amount of&#x2014;of picking and
                    choosing among the possibilities of his action, so that his actions fit the
                    character which you believe in. After that, the&#x2014;the&#x2014;the
                    business of putting him down on paper is mechanical. It's&#x2014;I think, most of
                    the&#x2014;the writing has got to take place up here before you ever put the
                    pencil to the paper.  But the character's got to be true by your conception and
                    by your experience, and that would include, as we've just said, what you've
                    read, what you've imagined, what you've heard, all that going to giving you
                    the gauge to measure this imaginary character by, and once he comes alive and
                    true to you, and&#x2014;and he's important and moving, then it's not too much
                    trouble to put him down.

  <a name="wfaudio21.5">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong> Yes, ma'am.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I think my question follows a little bit from
                        that one. I was wondering, to what extent
                        <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[is]</span> the creative literary process really sometimes
                    painful, and if facility in writing necessarily goes with
                    excellence or the other way around. And if it's too difficult, does it appear to
                    the reader as being labored and&#x2014;and worked over?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Sometimes, probably. I think of&#x2014;of so much of Dreiser, that
                    must've been a terrific anguish to him to write. I can think of&#x2014;well,
                    Flaubert, say, that&#x2014;that sounds so easy, so simple, that must have
                    been a terrific effort to him, too. Probably you can't&#x2014;can't draw
                    any&#x2014;any general&#x2014;generalization from that. Now, what was the
                    question about the&#x2014; the&#x2014;the anguish and trouble. We almost
                    touched on that. Tell me that again, the first of your question was&#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I just wanted to know to what extent <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[that in]</span> the creative literary
                    process is or can be expected to be&#x2014;?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, it's anything that&#x2014;that you like to do better than
                    anything else, of course you're willing to make sacrifices for, and usually the
                    things that you like to do are troublesome. That is, if you like to ski,
                    that's&#x2014;that's difficult. Everybody can't do it. But if you like it
                    well enough, that very anguish is fun. You do it because that gives you more
                    pleasure than anything else you can think of. It may be difficult, just like
                    mountain climbing. Nobody would climb mountains just for fun. People don't know
                    why they climb mountains, but that's their cup of tea they like. I think that's
                    true of the writer, that he's&#x2014;he's willing to face the&#x2014;the
                    anguish and the trouble of it because&#x2014;one reason is he can't help it,
                    he&#x2014;his choice is either to&#x2014;to write or not write, and he
                    says, "Well, I'm going to write anyway." The other is to have done the job well,
                    then he has&#x2014;has been repaid for the trouble and the suffering, we'll
                    call it, that he went through. Also, he has justified the fact that people must
                    suffer. There's really no good reason why there should be pain, you know.
                    There's no biological reason for it, and yet we constantly suffer pain and fear
                    and if the individual can make something which&#x2014;which makes him feel
                    good, that this is something that wasn't here before me, and I've made it, and
                    it's&#x2014;it's not quite good enough, but it's the best I can do, and I had
                    a good time at it, then that is his&#x2014;his pay for it.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.6">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>This sort of relates to the question before that, but when you are
                    writing a novel about a particular group of people and a particular environment,
                    just to what extent&#x2014;how fully do you imagine these people and this
                    environment beyond what actually goes into the novel?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I think one of the&#x2014;the first qualities a writer must have is
                    an inherent incapacity to stick to the truth,  that he will&#x2014;will take
                    characters, situations he has seen with the best intention in the world, but
                    despite himself, he cannot stick to that. He's going to improve it somehow. He's
                    trying to make something a little new, a little different than what was here
                    before, and he's not going to worry too much about whether he sticks to the
                    truth, and he finds that he's got away from fact, I mean, not the truth, which
                    is as I just said, there's not too much relation between fact and truth. When he
                    finds that he has got away from fact, he doesn't worry about that. Because he
                    has dedicated himself to stick to truth, as he sees it. I mean, by truth,
                    the&#x2014;the things which move people. The&#x2014;the&#x2014;the
                    desires, the passions in the human heart, the things that the human heart
                    considers important&#x2014;honor and truth, shame, baseness,
                    courage&#x2014;that's what he's writing about, and when he's got
                    to&#x2014;to ignore fact to do that better, then he won't hesitate to ignore
                    fact, because he's not really interested in facts. Fact can change too much. Fact
                    can be one thing today and something else tomorrow. A posted sign can change a
                    fact, you know, but it can't change the truth.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.7">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I think some magazines pay more for humorous stories than they do for
                    stories of a more serious nature, at least I've heard a number of writers say
                    that in relation to <em>The New Yorker</em>, supposedly because
                    humor is harder to write than&#x2014;humorous stories are harder to write
                    than serious ones. Do you find that true in your writing, that it's harder
                    for you to write a funny scene, a humorous scene, than it is to write one of a
                    serious nature?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>With me, the character does the work, and so I couldn't say that it's
                    more difficult to write a funny story than a sad one.  That I think the writer is
                    mainly not writing a story. He's writing about people. He thinks of the
                    character. He gets that character from observation, from experience, from
                    imagination, and suddenly that character himself or herself turns out to be
                    funny, and then she says and does funny things. I think maybe what you might
                    call a professional writer that&#x2014;that has a&#x2014;a knack for
                    composition, for knowing what magazines will pay the best price for and has the
                    talent to&#x2014;to write something to fit that, now he may be able to answer
                    that question better than me, but I think I've found it more satisfactory to
                    write mainly about people and let the character himself&#x2014;if he's comic, then he
                    does and says comic things, and I don't think I would worry too much about
                        that.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.8">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, you've stated that your method of composition is just to
                    let the story write itself.  And I was wondering if you could tell us whether or not Sherwood Anderson
                    wrote in <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[a&#x2014;similar to]</span> this fashion.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I think so, yes. He&#x2014;writing was&#x2014;was very difficult
                    for him because he took it up late in life and contrary to his tradition and his
                    training. He had been successful in the&#x2014;the ordinary shape of the
                    American dream, which was to come from nothing and&#x2014;and by your own
                    shrewdness and skill make something of yourself and establish a certain position
                    in the community. Then suddenly he decided he wanted to be a writer, and he, at
                    his age, he&#x2014;he was thinking always, "Well, now am I good enough to be a
                    writer? Is this a mistake? Maybe rather than to try to be a writer and fail, I
                    should've stuck to what I had trained myself to do," and he himself didn't have
                    the confidence in what he did. It would be other people that would say, "Well,
                    this is&#x2014;this is splendid. This is marvelous. Few people can match
                    that." He never did quite believe that. He was afraid that somebody might come
                    along and say, "This is nonsense, it's trash." And if someone had, he would've
                    believed that, that he himself didn't have the confidence in what he did or in
                    the doing of it, which the person that begins to write, to want to be a writer
                    young has. When you're young, you know nothing. You believe that you can climb a
                    mountain or can fly an aeroplane faster or ride a racehorse than anybody else
                    can. You're not afraid to try anything.  But in his case, he&#x2014;he was
                    afraid. Did that answer the question or did it get away from the question?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Well, I don't know. It&#x2014;I thought it was very interesting. I don't know
                    whether exactly was the thing I was&#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, let's have your question again. I got off myself. That's my
                    fault.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I&#x2014;I was&#x2014;just wanted to know if he wrote in the same fashion you
                    did. You said that you just let the story write itself, and I was wondering if
                    he did the same thing.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, and&#x2014;generally, yes. I think that all people write
                    from&#x2014;in&#x2014;by the same method. It's a matter of&#x2014;of
                    imagining any number of things. The writer at the moment of putting it down has
                    got to be a censor, to say, "Now, this is&#x2014;this is right, this is wrong,"
                    and to throw away the wrong. Anderson didn't quite have that&#x2014;that
                    confidence in his own capacity to pick and choose. There was an instinct that
                    would save him in the end. A lot of&#x2014;of the stuff that went into
                    his&#x2014;his stories a man with a heart or mind more sure of himself
                    would've stricken out and would've gotten rid of some of the&#x2014;the sense
                    of fumbling and clumsiness, the heavy-footedness, which was in Anderson's
                    stories, which he himself didn't like, but in my opinion, it had a great deal to
                    do with making his stories. The very fact that they did sound clumsy and&#x2014;and not
                    quite strained but a little puzzled, that the truth did come out of&#x2014;of
                    all the heavy-footedness and the&#x2014;the fumbling, the&#x2014;whatever
                    it was that&#x2014;that made him go to the length of reducing some of it to
                    the sort of <em>First Reader</em> statements, gave something to
                    the final result that&#x2014;that no imitator could&#x2014;could match
                    probably. But it was much more of a unhappy strain to him, that he never got
                    the&#x2014;the pleasure of&#x2014;out of writing that a more facile
                    craftsman could've done. It had nothing to do with the result, of course, but it
                    just was.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Frederick Gwynn:</strong>Even if he didn't have confidence in his own ability to write well, do
                    you think he had the confidence in his own vision of some truth?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Absolutely, I do. That is why he stopped being a successful advertiser
                    and became an artist. He had absolute confidence in his vision and&#x2014;and
                    knew it was important enough for something to be done about it, for him to try
                    to&#x2014;to tell it, to show to people what he had seen, which
                    he&#x2014;he, in my opinion, he did marvelously well, but clumsily.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.9">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, this is another question about Anderson. One critic
                    suggested Sherwood Anderson felt a particular kinship to Gertrude Stein. Miss
                    Stein is spoken of so frequently in connection with the writers of the Twenties,
                    that I would be interested to know whether you recall any discussion by Anderson
                    of her, of her work, and its supposed influence upon himself.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, he had the&#x2014;the unlettered man's boundless and almost
                    baseless respect for&#x2014;for literacy, for education, and she
                    was&#x2014;was an extremely versatile creature that way. She spoke two or
                    three different languages, and she came from a background of people that took
                    the best of education as a matter of course, which he didn't have. Also, she was
                    one of the few people that he could trust. I mean that&#x2014;that when she
                    said that what he was doing was&#x2014;was good, he never doubted it, because
                    he knew that she would never do anything to hurt him. Other people that told him
                    it was good, he never did quite trust. He said, "Well&#x2014;well, maybe
                    they'll&#x2014;they'll do something to hurt me tomorrow. I'm afraid of them."
                     But with her he never was, because he knew that she was a&#x2014;well, you
                    might say a lady, and wasn't&#x2014;was never going to hurt him.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.10">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, do you believe that Sherwood Anderson was too deliberate in
                    his use of <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[symbols]</span> or do you believe that some of
                    his&#x2014;these symbols were unconsciously used in <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>A little of both. You've got to remember that suddenly at the age of
                    about 40 he decided to be a writer. He had to learn a complete new trade with a
                    complete new equipment, and up to that time, he had probably not thought too
                    much about symbolism. He had to teach himself that as he went along.  But
                    he&#x2014;what he taught himself, he&#x2014;he would stop to prove
                    to&#x2014;to be sure that it was right, that it was in&#x2014;in accord
                    with the&#x2014;with the symbolism of&#x2014;of the new psychology, which
                    was coming along at that time.  But he had to teach himself his trade as he went
                    along.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.11">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Frederick Gwynn:</strong>Do you happen to remember how you first met Mr. Anderson?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, I had&#x2014;had worked in a New York bookstore. The manager was
                    Elizabeth Prall, a Miss Prall then. Later I heard that she had married Anderson,
                    was living in New Orleans. I happened to be in New Orleans, and I had gone to
                    call on her, because I&#x2014;I wasn't going to&#x2014;to bust in on Mr.
                    Anderson without an invitation from him. I didn't think that I would see him at
                    all, that he would probably be in his study working, but it happened that he was
                    in the room at the time.  And we talked, and we liked one another from the start,
                    and it was this&#x2014;just the chance that I had gone to call on Miss Prall,
                    that I had known, who had been kind to me when I was a clerk in a book store,
                    that I came to meet him.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.12">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Frederick Gwynn:</strong>Sir, I'd like to follow that up just once, if I may, sir. We were talking
                    about the background of Anderson's writing, and all of the writing out of the
                    '20s, and how people often gathered in groups in Greenwich Village and Chicago
                    and New Orleans. Was there something in New Orleans that pulled you down there,
                        or were&#x2014;were you just making a&#x2014;a trip?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, yes, I had heard of <em>The Double Dealer</em> and
                    the people there for years. At that time, I went to New Orleans to&#x2014;to
                    get a job in a ship and go to Europe. That was why I happened to be in New
                    Orleans at that time. That I hadn't&#x2014;it was no pull to be a part of a
                    literary group, no. That I had felt the pull&#x2014;I&#x2014;I think that
                    any young writers does feel that pull, to&#x2014;to be with people
                    that&#x2014;that have the same problems and&#x2014;and the same interests
                    as him, that&#x2014;that won't laugh at what he's trying to do, that won't
                    laugh at&#x2014;at what he says no matter how foolish it might sound to the
                    Philistine.  But that was the&#x2014;the reason I was in New Orleans, was to
                    get a job with a ship.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.13">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I'd like to follow up your remark about the Philistine for one minute if
                    I can. During the past hundred years or so, much has been said and written about
                    the gulf between the writer and the other people <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[of his own
                        time]</span>. If this gulf and supposed lack of understanding is a
                    certainty between the writer and his time does exist, what would you suggest
                    <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[are some of its causes]</span>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Probably the writer is just too confoundedly busy with his own private
                    affairs to have much time for his contemporary scene, that he's aware of it, but
                    he ain't too interested in it, that to him, the world is not just A.D. this
                    particular year. To him, the world is all man <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[would call]</span>
                    anguish in the books and the plays and the poems. That's where he lives. He just
                    happens to have to eat in&#x2014;in 1958, but he don't
                    really live there. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.14">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, it's been stated that you regard civilization as evil and
                    nature as good, and in "The Bear," you seem to indicate that the purity of
                    untouched nature as opposed to the tainted air that hangs about the human
                    spoilers of the wilderness, that there is this difference.  Is this the
                    result of a belief that man, if he returns to a natural life, can be
                    rejuvenated?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, and if I ever gave that impression in my work, that's not quite
                    true. I think that with any writer&#x2014;civilization, his age, his time, is
                    a part of the equipment, the reservoir that he will write from, that that is
                    the&#x2014;the writer, the artist, probably don't think anything is either
                    good or bad. It just is, and it's vastly interesting because it moves, and that
                    is the&#x2014;the source and the material from which he's going to try to
                    make something. It's motion. It's people, no matter whether what they do is
                    cowardly or brave or&#x2014;or a nuisance or diverting 
                    or entertaining. It's still motion, and he himself hasn't got time, or inclination
                    either, to judge it. I think that anyone who says civilization is&#x2014;is
                    bad and&#x2014;and non-civilization is therefore good, and if man could just
                    leave civilization and live in a tree and eat nuts, <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> that  
                    he'd be better off, I&#x2014;some men might be better
                    off with that, but not everybody would. If&#x2014;if&#x2014;if you like to
                    live in a tree and eat nuts, then you'd be better off and be happier, <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> 
                    but the other people that are just as honorable
                    and just as brave that live in the middle of civilization.  But that's all part
                    of the&#x2014;the reservoir that you write from. That's part of the
                    experience, to be in the midst of <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[it, the]</span> motion.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.15">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Do you think that Sherwood Anderson could've expanded 
                    his <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em> into a series of novels as you've done
                    with your Yoknapatawpha County people, or do you think that he's necessarily
                    more limited to a form like the short story?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>He was, yes, limited to that form, and his tragedy was that he was
                    limited to that one book, that&#x2014;that was&#x2014;was truth as he saw
                    it. It was valid, true truth, but he had done it that one time, and he never
                    could do it again.  Because the truth, it was as though the truth that he was
                    capable of burst on him like a&#x2014;a thunderclap all in one flash, that
                    there was nothing to progress from nor toward, that it all happened to him like
                    a&#x2014;a&#x2014;a house falling on him.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio21.16">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, many of the characters in <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em> had
                    the problem of not being able to communicate with their fellow man, and I think
                    some of your characters also seem to have that trouble. Now, you've said that
                    the most important thing for man is for him to be able to believe in himself. Do
                    you believe that before he can believe in himself, he must overcome this barrier
                    of communication <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[with others]</span>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>He would be happier if he could overcome the barrier. I don't believe
                    that the fact that he feels he can't communicate would have anything to do with
                    his own belief in himself. I don't think that&#x2014;that whether the writer
                    believes he can't communicate or not, he can and he does. I imagine that there's
                    really nobody that&#x2014;that doesn't communicate. It may be
                    he'll&#x2014;he&#x2014;he won't want to, that he'll think
                    that&#x2014;that he's sufficient, can be an island to himself, but he can't.
                    Whether he wants to or not, he belongs to mankind, too.  And in the very fact of
                    belonging to mankind, he communicates with mankind. He may not be able to do it
                    articulately. He may not have the&#x2014;the quality of&#x2014;of
                    rhetoric, but there's&#x2014;there's more to communication than speech, you
                    know.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>That's what I meant. I meant just the characters that couldn't seem to
                    get to know people in <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em>. There're quite a
                    few characters in that book that are sort of isolated and frustrated because
                    they couldn't seem to get to know other people. I didn't mean <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[writing or speech]</span>.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Oh, I see. I think that was&#x2014;was out of Anderson's own nature,
                    that he himself didn't believe that communication was&#x2014;was more
                    difficult. I think maybe that he expected more of people than he ever found in
                    people, and these characters in his book, because of what they thought was a
                    lack of&#x2014;an inability to communicate was, they simply couldn't find
                    the&#x2014;the&#x2014;the fine virtues in mankind that Mr. Anderson
                    himself believed were there. They're not there. Man is capable of anything, of
                    everything, but of no particular virtue, no particular evil. He's
