  <p><strong>Moderator:</strong>Good evening, ladies and
					gentlemen. On behalf of the Jefferson Society, Omicron Delta Kappa, and the
						Raven Society, I welcome you tonight to what we consider a&#x2014;a rare honor and a
					privilege. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to a gentleman
					who I don't believe could be any&#x2014;could have been any more aptly chosen, a
					gentleman who is a member of the Jefferson Society and at one time served as her
					president, who is a member of Omicron Delta Kappa&#x2014;Kappa, a member in
					longstanding of the Raven Society and a holder of the Raven Award, Dean of the
					Law School, Dean Ribble. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.2">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Dean F. D. G. Ribble:</strong>Ladies and gentlemen, I shall not
					introduce our distinguished speaker who happily has been a member of our
					community for a year and half. I would like to just say a word of thanks to the
					three ancient and honorable organizations which have planned this meeting for
					us. They're all very old. As we say in law, so old that memory&#x2014;the memory of man
					runneth not to the contrary. The oldest, I believe, is the Jefferson Society. It
					started in 1825 and had as one of its first members Edgar Allan Poe, so you see
					their interest in men of letters is quite old. The other two have equally and
					greatly added to the life of this University, and the three of them are adding
					to their fame and to our debt of gratitude to them by presenting to us tonight a
					gentlemen who is a great American, a great southerner, and one whom we're very
						proud to have as a member of our university, Mr. William Faulkner. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.3">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>With Dean Ribble's permission, I
					would like to elaborate that a little more. With Professor Stovall's blessings,
					Mr. Gwynn and Mr. Blotner have agreed that my tenure as writer-in-residence here
					might be a little better if we kept it informal, serious but not too
					concentrated and continuous. That is, when I'm on the fifth floor of Cabell Hall,
					I'm writer-in-residence. When I'm not there, then I'm just a Mississippi citizen
					that likes and admires Virginia and Virginia people. I hope that&#x2014;that now you
					will take me under those conditions, that I'm just a private citizen here that
					likes and admires Virginia, Virginia people, even when they may not like what
					I'm going to say. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> That is, as far as the
					University is concerned, I am free home here, and as far as you're concerned, I
					am free game. Only do flush me first. Don't shoot me sitting. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>

  <a name="wfaudio20_1.4">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Mr. Chairman, members of the Jefferson Society, the Raven
						Society, ODK, and ladies and gentlemen, a hundred years ago Abraham Lincoln
						said, "This nation cannot endure half slave and half free." If he were alive
						today, he would amend it: "This nation cannot endure containing a minority
						as large as ten percent held second class in citizenship by the accident of
						physical appearance." As a lesser man might put it, this nor any country or
						community of people can no more get along in peace with ten percent of its
						population arbitrarily unassimilated than a town of five thousand people can
						get along in peace with five hundred unbridled horses loose in the streets,
						or, say, a community of five thousand cats with five hundred unassimilated
						dogs among them, or vice versa. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> For
						peaceful coexistence, all must be one thing&#x2014;either all first-class citizens
						or all second-class citizens, either all people or all horses, either all
						cats or all dogs.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.5">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					Perhaps the Negro is not yet capable of more than
						second-class citizenship. His tragedy may be that so far he is competent for
						equality only in the ratio of his white blood. But even if that is so, the
						problem of the second-class citizens still remains. It would not solve the
						problem even if the Negro were himself content to remain only a second-class
						citizen, even though relieved of his first-class responsibilities by his
						classification. The fact would still remain that we are a nation established
						on the fact that we are only ninety percent unified in power. With only
						ninety percent of unanimity, we would face, and hope to survive in it, an
						inimical world unified against us, even if only in inimicality. We cannot be
						even ninety percent unified against that inimical world, which outnumbers
						us, because too much of even that ninety percent of power is spent and
						consumed by the physical problem of the ten percent of
							irresponsibles.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.6">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					It is easy enough for the North to blame on us, the
						South, the fact this problem is still unsolved. If I were a northerner,
						that's what I would do, tell myself that one hundred years ago we&#x2014;both of
						us, North and South&#x2014;had put this to the test and had solved it. That it is
						not us, the North, but you, the South, who have refused to accept that
						verdict. Nor will it help us any to remind the North that by ratio of Negro
						to white in population, there's probably more of inequality and injustice
						there than with us.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.7">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					Instead, we should accept that gambit. Let us say to the
						North, "All right, it is our problem, and we will solve it." For the sake of
						the argument, let us agree that as yet the Negro is incapable of equality
						for the reason that he could not hold and keep it, even if were forced on
						him with bayonets, that once the bayonets were removed, the first smart and
						ruthless man, black or white, who came along would take it away from him,
						because he, the Negro, is not yet capable of, or refuses to accept, the
						responsibilities of equality.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.8">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					So we, the white man, must take him in hand and teach
						him that responsibility. This will not be the first time nor the last time
						in the long record of man's history that moral principle has been identical
						with and even inextricable from practical common sense. Let us teach him
						that, in order to be free and equal, he must first be worthy of it, and then
						forever afterward work to hold and keep and defend it. He must learn to
						cease forever more thinking like a Negro and acting like a Negro. This will
						not be easy for him. His burden will be that, because of his race and color,
						it will not suffice for him to think and act like just any white man. He
						must think and act like the best among white men. Because where the white
						man, because of his race and color, can practice morality and rectitude just
						on Sunday and let the rest of the week go hang, the Negro can never let up
						nor deviate.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.9">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					That is our job here in the South. It is possible that
						the white race and the Negro race can never really like and trust each
						other&#x2014;this for the reason that the white man can never really know the
						Negro, because the white man has forced the Negro to be always a Negro
						rather than another human being in their dealings. And therefore the Negro
						cannot afford, does not dare, to be open with the white man and let the
						white man know what he, the Negro, thinks. But I do know that we in the
						South, having grown up and lived among Negroes for generations, are capable
						in individual cases, of liking and trusting individual Negroes, which the
						North can never do because the northerner only fears him.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.10">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					So we alone can teach the Negro the responsibility of
						personal morality and rectitude, either by taking him into our white
						schools, or giving him white teachers in his own schools, until we have
						taught the teachers of his own race to teach and train him in these hard and
						unpleasant habits. Whether or not he ever learns his ABCs or what to do with
						common fractions won't matter. What he must learn are the hard
						things&#x2014;self-restraint, honesty, dependability, purity, to act not even as
						well as just any white man, but to act as well as the best of white men. If
						we don't, we will spend the rest of our lives dodging among the five hundred
						unbridled horses. We will look forward each year to another Clinton or
						Little Rock, not only further and further to wreck what we have so far
						created of peaceful relations between the two races, but to be international
						monuments and milestones to our ridicule and shame.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.11">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					And the place for this to begin is Virginia, the mother
						of all the rest of us <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[through]</span> the South. Compared to you, my
						country&#x2014;Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas&#x2014;is still frontier, still wilderness.
						Yet even in our wilderness we look back to that mother stock as though it
						were not really so distant and so far removed. Even in our wilderness the
						old Virginia blood still runs, and the old Virginia names&#x2014;Byrd and Lee and
						Carter&#x2014;still endure. There is no family in our wilderness but has that old
						aunt or grandmother to tell the children as soon as they can hear and
						understand, "Your blood is Virginia blood, too. Your
						great-great-great-grandfather was born in Rockbridge or Fairfax or Prince
						George, Valley or Piedmont or Tidewater," right down to the nearest
						milestone, so that Virginia is a living place to that child long before he
						ever heard or cares about New York or, for that matter, America.
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.12">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>
					So let it begin in Virginia, toward whom the rest of us
						are already looking as the child looks toward the parent for a sign, a
						signal where to go and how to go. A hundred years ago the hot-heads of
						Mississippi and Georgia and South Carolina would not listen when the mother
						of us all tried to check our reckless and headlong course. We ignored you
						then, to all our grief. Yours more than any since you bore more of the
						battles. But this time we will hear you. Let this be the voice of that
						wilderness, speaking not just to Mother Virginia but to the best of her
						children&#x2014;sons found and chosen worthy to be trained to the old pattern in
						the University established by Mr. Jefferson to be not just a dead monument
						to, but the enduring fountain of his principles of order within the human
						condition and the relationship of man with man&#x2014;the messenger, the mouthpiece
						of all, saying to the mother of us all, "Show us the way and lead us in it."  I
						believe we will follow you. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span>
					
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.13">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Dean F. D. G. Ribble:</strong>Mr. Faulkner is good enough to
					answer any questions that you care to raise. You don't have to take issue with
					the very fine sentiments just expressed.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.14">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, you spoke of the Negro as a
					child, more or less, who had to be taught how to live like&#x2014;like the best white
					man, <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[but do you think that]</span> before that that the&#x2014;well,
						the&#x2014;<span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[awful lot of this trouble that's been caused for colored people
						are by irresponsible white people]</span>? Don't you think it would be a
					good idea to educate the white people to accept the Negro?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, I do. Of course, this could go into&#x2014;to great length. I was simply
					stating the proposition in its simplest terms, as it seemed to me. I think that
					all that&#x2014;that don't violently repudiate what I've said will agree that the white
					man is responsible for the Negro's condition, the fact that the Negro does act
					like a Negro and can live among us and be irresponsible, that the white man has
					got to be himself capable to teach the Negro to be more responsible than he is.
					Yes, I agree with you. But then, the Negro is not going to wait right now while
					the white man educates himself in order to educate the Negro. We've got to do
					both at the same time. The Negro is not going to wait any longer.
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.15">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, in your talk you had an analogy comparing the Negro with&#x2014;with
					unbridled horses. If you tried to break these unbridled horses, and you turned a
					lot of tame ones in, don't you think it's a possibility that you may wind up
					with just a big group of half-wild horses? <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, of course, I used the&#x2014;the horse as a&#x2014;as a quick analogy to&#x2014;to
					state a condition. What I meant by that was, the horse that&#x2014;that can be trained
					and maybe has been trained&#x2014;we'll assume that&#x2014;that while that horse was a slave,
					then&#x2014;then he was a&#x2014;a docile, well-behaved horse. But then he was&#x2014;the burden of
					slavery was lifted from him, and he was suddenly freed. That he is still capable
					of being a docile member of society, but the condition in which he was compelled
					to be a docile member is gone, and so we will have to establish a new condition
					in which he is&#x2014;is docile not through pressure, but because he himself wants to
					be. He has got to be taught that it's best for me to&#x2014;to pull my share in the
					traces if that's what we've got to do, than to run wild.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.16">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, don't you feel that
					if Virginia did integrate, that the people in Mississippi and Alabama and
					Arkansas and those places would sort of lose their respect for Virginians as
					Southerners and sort of classify them as sort of northerners? <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, sir, I&#x2014;I do not. There's a&#x2014;a noisy minority in Mississippi and
					Arkansas, and&#x2014;and I rather think it's in Virginia too, that will go to any
					length before they will&#x2014;will risk in any way improving the Negro's class
					condition, for economic reasons. That's&#x2014;that's what's so in Mississippi, anyway. But
					there are people in Mississippi and in Alabama and in Georgia, in the middle
					of&#x2014;of&#x2014;of where the Ku Klux Klan and Citizens Councils are active, that do
					believe that whether they like it or not, there's a situation now which
					simply will not go on any longer, and our choice is either to do nothing and be
					run over and&#x2014;and trampled, or take ourselves, try to take charge of these
					unbridled horses. And I think that if&#x2014;if the people in Mississippi and Arkansas
					and Alabama could find that there were people in Virginia that would take the
					lead in this, they would follow for the reason that there is a respect, a&#x2014;a
					feeling of veneration toward Virginia that exists, as I tried to explain,
					everywhere in the rest of the South. Whether it's&#x2014;it's valid or not, I don't
					know, and from some of the things that I have seen Virginia do since I've been
					here, I may agree that it's not too valid, but I think that basically there is
					that feeling, and I believe that there is in Virginia the capacity to take the
					first step in solving&#x2014;solving this problem, and if it is taken in Virginia, the
					people in Mississippi and Alabama will follow when they wouldn't follow Alabama
					nor Mississippi.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.17">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Dean F. D. G. Ribble:</strong>There's someone over here.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, on the subject of race relations, it seems to me that the
					continuum in the United States is one of polarity, that is, the only view
					tolerated is an&#x2014;is the extreme view. If you agree with that premise of mine,
					would you say that there will be resurgence&#x2014;a resurgence of a moderate view on
					this subject, and what is your conception of that view?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I would say that the Negro doesn't want to mix with white people any
					more than white people want to mix with the Negro. The Negro simply wants the
					right himself to decide not to mix. I think that&#x2014;that he doesn't want to&#x2014;to go
					to white schools just because they're white schools. I think he wants to go to
					them because he's under the delusion that white schools are good schools. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> 
					I think from&#x2014;from what I've seen of a lot of schools
					that no really industrious Negro would want to go to one. Now that's not true of
					all schools, but&#x2014;but it's true of too many white schools. I think that what he
					wants is mainly the chance himself to decide to be segregated, and that if he
					had that, with schools so good that the people in the schools would be too busy
					passing the work to care what color who's sitting next to them was, there
					wouldn't be any trouble about integration in schools.
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.18">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, would you consider one of the problems&#x2014;<span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[disregarding that
						you mentioned that the Negro was fighting for the chance to be able to
						segregate himself]</span>&#x2014;is it not true that that is what the white
					southerner is fighting to maintain? In other words, if the Negro is fighting for
					the right of association, aren't the southerners fighting for the equivalent
					right to disassociate? In other words, they don't feel like sacrificing their
					rights completely in order for the Negro to achieve the same rights. In other
					words, they don't feel that they are balanced. Do you think that is a valid
					cause for the southern white to be fighting so strenuously to preserve his
					equivalent right of disassociation?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I would say it's valid assuming that the southerner's fear is valid. I
					think that his&#x2014;his violent attitude toward integration is based in fear. It's&#x2014;in
					Mississippi, it's mainly an economic fear, that he has trained the Negro to&#x2014;to
					get along with&#x2014;with inferior tools and bad stock and yet to make a living and 
					send his children to school. The white man is afraid that if the Negro has
					better tools and better stock, the Negro will take the white man's economy away
					from him. I think he is afraid that if he gives the Negro a chance to choose to
					be segregated, the Negro may not choose it, that if he was just convinced
					that&#x2014;that the Negro would want to keep his own churches and his own schools and
					not mix with white people, then the white man would give him that chance, but I
					doubt if&#x2014;if some of the white people in the South can ever be brought to take
					that chance.
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.19">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, I believe you inferred in the earlier part of your speech
					that a good deal of the prejudice is against the Negro because of his color, and
					if that be so, I wonder if you really think that integration is going to solve
					this prejudice?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I myself think that&#x2014;that integration as they mean it now will&#x2014;will never
					occur, that the Negro doesn't want it either. I would say, though, in&#x2014;in five
					hundred years he will have vanished, and I imagine then anyone that wants to
					join the D.A.R. will have to prove that&#x2014;that she's got somewhere a strain of
					Negro blood, that they'll be descendants <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> of
					, <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span> but as&#x2014;I think as the NAACP preaches it, and as
					the White Citizens Councils preach against it, it&#x2014;it won't occur because the
					Negro himself, as a race, doesn't want to mix with white people. He don't like
					white people that well. But I do think that all the laws in the world are not
					going to make the two races mix if&#x2014;if they don't want to, just as all the laws
					in the world won't keep them apart if they do want to.
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.20">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Virginia, and I think several other Southern states, have laws which say
					that in case schools are mixed with colored and white, these schools will be
					closed. Do you think that when these schools are closed, the communities will
					finally come about to deciding that it's better to integrate and educate, or
					just do away with education?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I think they will come around to integrate for the reason that we 
					have&#x2014;have made our schools in this country to a sort of a national system of
					babysitters, and by the time these children <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>
					have been at home underfoot the parents are going to be willing for them to go
					to school no matter who else is there. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>
				</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio20_1.21">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, what specific program would you advocate to implement this education
					of the Negro race?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I would say first to raise the standard of all the schools to the best.

					I mean by that that education should be a privilege. It shouldn't be a duty
					that I'm made to do by law whether I want to or not. That is, the law can make
					me go to school, but they can't make me do anything there I don't want to. It
					should be a privilege. People should be willing to&#x2014;to walk four or five miles to
					get to school.

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Do you agree with the administration's proposal for federal aid to the
					schools?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, if&#x2014;if the standards of the schools were improved. I think that&#x2014;that
					more money ain't going to improve the schools, that the schools themselves are
					going to have to begin to improve themselves. They're going to have to get rid
					of a lot of people that don't have any business in school. They've got to give
					teachers better pay and give the teacher some pride in his job and some security
					that nobody will&#x2014;will fire him. But, yes, it&#x2014;federal aid will&#x2014;will have to go to
					the schools because I think the&#x2014;the communities can't or&#x2014;or won't.

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>And at what age do you advocate
					this entrance examination for students&#x2014;elementary school or high school?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>That should&#x2014;I should think the entrance examination would come only to
					give the failure a second chance, that he can go to school as he does now. The
					first time he fails, he goes to a trade school, but he will have the right to
					swot up and take an entrance examination to get back into the grade that he&#x2014;he
					lost. I think that at college it should be a board, yes. That no matter what
					credits he brings from his school he should pass a board examination to get into
						college, yes.

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, do you think that the federal government will allow the Negro to

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>The federal government, I imagine, will do whatever the&#x2014;the most folks
					hollering the loudest at it insist on. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>It seems like the various groups up North which are pushing integration
					so hard now will&#x2014;should the South try to adopt this voluntary segregation&#x2014;leave
					the&#x2014;both the white and black alone then to make that choice, or do you think
					it's sort of wrapped up in&#x2014;in power politics from the large northern cities,
					that we are going to continue to be the whipping boy, for better or worse?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I think that most of the&#x2014;the noisy vociferous people in the North don't
					really know what they're talking about. If they would come down here and look at
					it, they would know a good deal more than they do now. And I think that they are
					going to learn, because there are more and more Negroes moving to the North. In
					my county there were 6,000 people moved out since the last sentence&#x2014;census.
					There were&#x2014;something like 4,800 of them were&#x2014;were Negroes. I was through the
					country last winter bird-shooting. I would see houses empty, house after house.
					One family on my place gone to Chicago. How long they'll stay, I don't know. I
					imagine they'll be back in a year, but they've&#x2014; <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> 
					And I think when more and more of these people begin to crowd in among the
					white folks in the North, a lot of them that talk so loud now will begin to

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, if the Negroes are the wild horses which you imply they are, how are
					they to pass the entrance exams? It seems to me they'll all end up in the Army,

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, sir, that was an unfortunate simile, but I&#x2014;I used something <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> 
					that we were all familiar with to express quickly
					a condition in which ten percent of the population were&#x2014;were not allowed to&#x2014;to
					be members of the population, except under sufferance. That's all I meant. I
					didn't mean that they were horses at all. We could reverse it and say that a&#x2014;a
					community of fifty thousand horses with five hundred loose men moving around in
					it, if you like. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> I simply meant that we have
					got to&#x2014;to&#x2014;to find some&#x2014;some mutual ground to meet on, not socially so much as
					economically, and&#x2014;and, of course, that&#x2014;that implies education, culture. That is,
					the Negro can be equal without having to&#x2014;to come in and sleep with
						you.

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, it seems that the need by the early first colonies, the
					need for an agrarian society to have labor, gave birth to this great problem,
					and it also seems that the continual effort and attempt to maintain the society
					even after 1865 has prolonged and added to the problem. Do you think, and this
					is my question, that the advent of industry in the South, the industrialization
					of the South, and the possible eventual destruction of the remaining&#x2014;of the
					agrarian&#x2014;agrarian society will have any effect upon this problem? <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some end of recording happening">[end of recording]</span></p>
