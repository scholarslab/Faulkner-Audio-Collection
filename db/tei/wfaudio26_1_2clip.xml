                    <u who="WF">He never did. He said, "If I were brave I would—I—I
                        might say this to my father, whether it was a lie or not." Or—or, "If
                        I were—if I would say this to my father, maybe he could answer me back
                        the magic word which would relieve me of this anguish and agony which I live
                        with." No, they were imaginary. He just said "Suppose I say this to my father.
                        Would it help me? Would it clarify? Would I see clearer
                        what it is that I anguish over?"</u>

                        weakling that even if they had been no kin, she would never had chosen him for
                        her sweetheart. She would have chosen one like the—the ex-soldier she
                        did, but never anybody like Quentin.</u>
