<p><strong>Edward Stephenson: </strong>Some of&mdash;some of us were talking about Thomas Wolfe this morning, and

						dialect as well as his native southern, so perhaps you could.</p>

<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>Probably not. The colonel wouldn't have said "whupped." He&mdash;by&mdash;by

<p><strong>Joseph Blotner: </strong>I think that's one of the most interesting passages from the point of
