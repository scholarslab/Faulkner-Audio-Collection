<p><div class="speaker">Moderator</div>Ladies and gentlemen, on
					behalf of the seminar committee, may I welcome you to this twenty-sixth
					Washington and Lee seminar in literature. The committee wishes me also to
					express our appreciation to the University of Virginia for this gracious loan
					today of their most distinguished writer-in-residence. We are especially
					indebted to Professors Frederick Gwynn and Joseph Blotner, who have accompanied
					him here. Our speaker intends to read from his latest novel, <em>The Town</em>, 
						and at the conclusion of that he will welcome questions from
					you all. It would be presumptuous indeed for me to attempt any formal
					introduction of our speaker today, but it is certainly my very great privilege
						to present to you Mr. William Faulkner of Oxford, Mississippi.  <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span></p>

					There is a ridge; you drive on beyond Seminary Hill and
						in time you come upon it: a mild unhurried farm road presently mounting to
						cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from Jefferson to
						the world. And now, looking back and down, you see all Yoknapatawpha in the
						dying last of day beneath you. There are stars now, just pricking out as you
						watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning; the end of
						day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith.
						Yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth, drained from
						earth backward and upward into that cooling green, but rather had gathered,
						pooling for an unmoving moment yet, among the low places of the ground so
						that ground, earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are
						dark, standing darkly and immobile out of it.

					Then, as though at signal, the

						questing, not quiring, but choiring as if they were tiny incessant
						appeaseless voices, cries, words. And you stand suzerain and solitary above
						the whole sum of your life beneath the incessant ephemeral spangling. First
						is Jefferson, the center, radiating weakly its puny glow into space; beyond
						it, enclosing it, spreads the County, tied by the diverging roads to that
						center as is the rim to the hub by its spokes, yourself detached as God
						Himself for this moment above the cradle of your nativity and of the men and
						women who made you, the record and chronicle of your native land proffered
						for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like the ripples on living water
						above the dreamless slumber of your past; you to preside unanguished and
						immune above this miniature of man's passions and hopes and
						disasters&mdash;ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation
						and pity and honor and sin and pride all bound, precarious and ramshackle,
						held together by the web, the iron-thin warp and woof of his rapacity but

						the wild Chickasaw king, with his Negro slaves and his sister's son called

						since there were old men in the county in my own childhood who had actually
						seen it), stole an entire steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles
						overland to convert into a palace proper to aggrandise his state; the same
						fat black rich plantation earth still synonymous of the proud fading white
						plantation names whether we&mdash;I mean of course they&mdash;ever
						actually owned a plantation or not: Sutpen and Sartoris and Compson and
						Edmonds and McCaslin and Beauchamp and Grenier and Habersham and Holston and
						Stevens and De Spain, generals and governors and judges, soldiers (even if
						only Cuban lieutenants) and statesmen failed or not, and simple politicians
						and over-reachers and just simple failures, who snatched and grabbed and
						passed and vanished, name and face and all. Then the roadless, almost
						pathless perpendicular hill-country of McCallum and Gowrie and Frazier and
						Muir translated intact with their pot stills and speaking only the old
						Gaelic and not much of that, from Culloden to Carolina, then from Carolina
						to Yokpatawpha still intact and not speaking much of anything except now
						they called the pots "kettles" though the drink (even I can remember this)
						was still usquebaugh; then and last on to where Frenchman's Bend lay beyond
						the southeastern horizon, cradle of Varners and ant-heap for the northeast
						crawl of Snopes.

						spring which an American poet, a fine one, a woman and so she knows, called
						girls' weather and boys' luck. Which was not the first day at all, not Eden
						morning at all because girls' weather and boys' luck is the sum of all the
						days: the cup, the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no
						more; proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even that
						sometimes premature, too soon. Because the tragedy of life is, it must be

					care what anybody else thinks about it. It's got to please himself, and so he is

					has very much judgment about what he reads. He will read anything. As he gets

					That is a&mdash;a communal business. The actor gives something to it. The

<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Do you consider Salinger to
						be one of our better writers ?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>I was impressed with one book of his. It seemed to me that it showed
					a&mdash;it's not a fault. It's an evil that the writer has got
					to&mdash;to arm himself against, which is the pressure of our culture to
					compel everyone to belong to something, to a group. It's difficult to be an
					individual in our culture. I think that what I saw in&mdash;in that book was
					a tragedy which, in a way, represented Salinger's own tragedy. There was
					a&mdash;a&mdash;a young man, intelligent, a little more sensitive than
					most, who simply wanted to love mankind, and when he tried to break into
					mankind, to love mankind, man wasn't there. That, to me, was the tragedy of that
					book. That, to me, is&mdash;is the threat which all the young writers
					nowadays have got to be on guard against, the pressure to relinquish, submerge,
					individuality, the "me," into a mass of "us."  And I think
					that&mdash;that any first-rate writing has been in terms of the individual,
					who even in the moil and teem of the world was still "me," "myself." He got
					his&mdash;his elbows skinned and his head bumped now and then, but just with
					other heads and other elbows, not with machinery. There was nothing in the teem
					and moil of&mdash;of the world to destroy his&mdash;his soul by
					compressing him into a&mdash;a relinquishment of the "I
						am."

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Do you think the novel ?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>I would say it&mdash;it would go through phases like any other form
					of life or motion. It's got to be in motion. It's got to change. The only
					alternative to change is stasis, which is death. And it&mdash;it will
					change, yes. It may go into another medium. The novel may go into something
					visual, into&mdash;to moving pictures. But the novel as
					a&mdash;a&mdash;a quality will not change as long as&mdash;as people
					are trying to record man's victories and defeats, in terms of the recognizable
					human heart. Let's say that, as I put it, the highest form of writing is
					the&mdash;the poem. The poet has taken that&mdash;that tragic, beautiful
					moment of man's struggle within his dilemma and put it into fourteen lines. The
					second highest is the short story writer, who has been able to do it in ten
					pages. The novelist is the failure. He's a failed poet. It took him three hundred pages to
					isolate that tragic, beautiful, moving dilemma, victory or defeat, of fragile,
					invincible man in his dilemma. So the novel may change, but it&mdash;it
					will never vanish as a quality in culture.

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>No, I don't rate the writer quite between the acrobat and the seal, as
					Steinbeck said. I think that the fact that the writer in this country
					is&mdash;is treated with a slightly cavalier treatment might be good for him
					because one thing that the writer must have in order to be a good writer is
					humility. He must not take himself too seriously. He must take what he is doing
					with complete seriousness, but he mustn't take what he does with very much
					seriousness. He must keep himself an amateur. And so that may be pretty good for
					him. Maybe if&mdash;if this country gave writers more kudos and more

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>I don't like my style either. I think that&mdash;<span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> What I'm trying to say is that I think that no
					writer has got time to bother too much about writing style or writing rhetoric.
					If he does, he has probably got very little to say, that the story he's
					telling&mdash;he is trying to isolate this moment of man's struggle in the
					most moving way he can. And he will try style. He'll try metaphor. He'll try
					symbolism, to&mdash;to isolate that in the most moving way he can possibly
					do it. So the&mdash;in my opinion, the work itself creates its own style. 
					That when it's done the writer can look back and say, "This is clumsy. I wish I
					could think of a better way to do that." But he can't. He has done the best he
					could with it. To get all he can into it. It's&mdash;well, he has
					a&mdash;as we all do, an awareness of death, that he will not be here
					forever, that&mdash;that the end can be for him tomorrow. He has been
					troubled and moved so much by what he's seen of man's struggle that he wants to
					get that on paper, and he's afraid that if he puts it off, he will die before he
					does it. He, in effect, is like the man that's trying to carve the Lord's Prayer
					on the head of a pin. He's trying to put everything into one book, one
					page&mdash;the perfect thing would be to put all that history and anguish
					into one word, which you can't do. And the fumbling with style, with metaphor,
					symbolism, is simply his desperate, tragic attempt to get the beauty he has seen
					by simply being alive down on paper before he&mdash;before the lightning
					strikes. So he is&mdash;he might&mdash;that's why he could hate his
					style too, but this was the best he could do. That if he could do that over
					again, he is convinced he could do it better. I think every writer believes
					that, that if he could turn time back until this day last year that that book
					would be a better book. Of course, it wouldn't be, but he believes that. He
					can't do it, so he writes another book tomorrow. But he wants to be as lucid, as
					pure as light or clear water itself. And when it gets moiled and turgid, he is
					sorry. He grieves over that. Though&mdash;of course, he don't have to read
					it anymore. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> That's one

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>The writer is&mdash;has got to be born with curiosity about people

					wonder why man does what he does. I think that&mdash;that he&mdash;he
					doesn't need experience, personal experience, to write about people. Personal
					experience&mdash;as far as man goes, can come from the books he reads. But
					certainly the&mdash;the writer takes from every experience of any sort he's
					ever had. He&mdash;he robs and steals from everything he's heard or seen or
					read. He's amoral, but he's perfectly willing for anyone after him to rob and
					steal from him. He has the three, you might say, reservoirs that what he writes
					comes from. One is that experience. One is observation. The other is
					imagination. And nobody's to say just how much comes from what. But the
					imagination can carry the load. There was one blind man who was a pretty good

<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Mr. Faulkner, I've heard it reported that you've said in the past that

					<span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Do you care to comment on this]</span>?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, it was. I had&mdash;had been writing as an amateur and having a
					lot of fun at it. Then, all of a sudden, I found myself married, and I would
					need a little money, and I thought I might write something to make a little
					money with, so I thought of the most horrific story I could and wrote 
					it. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> Sent it in to the publisher.  He said, "Good Lord,
					man." This was nineteen&mdash;in the nineteen twenties, when you couldn't
					say the sort of things in books you can now. He said, "If we print this, we'll
					both be in jail." So he put it away, and I got a job and didn't need money too
					much. I wrote two more books, which were printed, and then one day I got the
					galley for <em>Sanctuary</em>, and I read it, and it was so bad
					because it was basely conceived that I wrote him and said that "we will just
					burn this up and forget about it." He said, "Well, I&mdash;I have had plates
						<span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[stamped]</span> for it." I said, "Well, then I'll rewrite it." He
					said, "That means that we'll have to make new plates. If you insist on
					rewriting, and if you will dig up $270, I will get the other $270, and we will
					make new plates." So I paid my half of the new plates and rewrote the book to
					make it at least honest. But I still don't like it because the whole conception
					was&mdash;was base. It did sell, and was going to make me a lot of money. The
					publisher went bankrupt, so I got just exactly what I deserved, and I learned my
					lesson from it. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> Since then, I've remained

					<span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[would you comment on his place in American]</span>
					?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>It's too soon to&mdash;to say, I think. It takes&mdash;takes a
					little time before the&mdash;the dross evaporates from anyone's work, until
					there is a distance for a true perspective. At one time, I was asked
					to&mdash;what I thought of my contemporaries. I said, "It's too soon to
					tell." The questioner said, "Well, haven't you got any opinion of them at all."
					I&mdash;I said, "Opinion of who?" He named Wolfe, Hemingway, Dos Passos,
					Caldwell, and me. I rated them then Wolfe first, me second, Dos Passos,
					Caldwell, and Hemingway. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> Not on&mdash;on
					what we'd accomplished, but only on the single general ground I could find,
					which was the&mdash;the attempt to do more than we could do, on the failure.
					I rated Wolfe because his was the most splendid failure. He had tried hardest to
					take all the experience that he was capable of observing and imagining and put
					it down in one book, on the head of a pin. He had the courage to experiment, to
					be&mdash;to write nonsense, to be foolish, to be sentimental, in the attempt
					to get down the&mdash;that single moving and passionate instance of man's
					struggle. I rated myself next because I had tried next hardest to get everything
					on one page. I rated the others down to Hemingway, not on the value of his work,
					which I thought was, per se, the best because it was intact and complete. But
					his was&mdash;showed less desire to try to get all of man's heart onto the
					pinhead. So I think it's too soon for anyone to have a&mdash;have an opinion
					about Wolfe. Maybe the only opinion to have about anybody is, "Do I like to read
					him or don't I?" And if I like to read him, he's all right. If I don't like to
					read him, then he may be all right for somebody else, but he ain't my cup of
