					<u who="G">Ladies and Gentleman, the

					Faulkner, and is also very pleased that so many of you were able to travel—so

					<head>Story, Excerpt 1</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction"> Pap got up a good hour before daylight and caught the
						mule and rid down to Killegrews' to borrow the froe and maul. He ought to
						been back with it in forty minutes. But the sun had rose and I had done
						milked and fed and was eating my breakfast when he got back, with the mule
						not only in a lather but right on the edge of the thumps too.<lb/>
						"Fox hunting,"
						he said. "Fox hunting. A seventy-year-old man, with both feet and one knee,
						too, already in the grave, squatting all night on a hill and calling himself
						listening to a fox race that he couldn't even hear unless they had come
						right up onto the same log he was setting on and bayed into his ear trumpet.
						Give me my breakfast," he told maw. "Whitfield is standing there right this
						minute, straddle of that board tree with his watch in his hand."<lb/>
						And he was.
						We rid on past the church, and there was not only Solon Quick's school-bus
						truck but Reverend Whitfield's old mare too. We tied the mule to a sapling
						and hung our dinner bucket on a limb, and with pap toting Killegrew's froe
						and maul and the wedges and me toting our ax, we went on to the board tree
						where Solon and Homer Bookwright, with their froes and mauls and axes and
						wedges, was setting on two upended cuts, and Whitfield was standing jest
						like pap said, in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants and necktie,
						holding his watch in his hand. It was gold and in the morning sunlight it
						looked as big as a full-growed squash.<lb/>
						"You're late," he said.

					<head>Story, Excerpt 2</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">So pap told them again about how Old
						Man Killegrew had been off fox hunting all night, and nobody at home to lend
						him the froe but Mrs. Killegrew and the cook. And naturally, the cook wasn't
						going to lend none of Killegrew's tools out, and Mrs. Killegrew was worser
						deaf than even Killegrew. If you was to run in and tell her the house was
						afire, she would jest keep on rocking and say she thought so, too,  <event desc="audience laughter"/> unless
						she began to holler back to the cook to turn the dogs loose before you could
						even open your mouth.<lb/>
						"You could have gone yesterday and borrowed the froe,"
						Whitfield said. "You have known for a month now that you had promised this
						one day out of a whole summer toward putting a roof on the house of God."<lb/>
						
						"We ain't but two hours late," pap said. "I reckon the Lord will forgive it.
						He ain't interested in time, nohow. He's interested in salvation."<lb/>
						Whitfield
						never even waited for pap to finish. It looked to me like he even got
						taller, thundering down at pap like a cloudburst. "He ain't interested in
						neither! Why should He be, when He owns them both? And why should He turn
						around for the poor, mizzling souls of men that can't even borrow tools in
						time to replace the shingles on His church, I don't know either. Maybe it's
						just because He made them. Maybe He just said to Himself: 'I made them; I
						don't know why. But since I did, I Godfrey, I'll roll my sleeves up and drag
						them into glory whether they will or no!'"

					<head>Story, Excerpt 3</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">But that wasn't here nor there neither now, and I reckon
						he knowed it, jest like he knowed there wasn't going to be nothing atall
						here as long as he stayed. So he put the watch back into his pocket and
						motioned Solon and Homer up, and we all taken off our hats except him while
						he stood there with his face raised into the sun and his eyes shut and his
						eyebrows looking big like iron-gray caterpillars lying along the edge of a
						cliff. "Lord," he said, "make them good straight shingles to lay smooth, and
						let them split out easy; they're for You," and opened his eyes and looked at
						us again, mostly at pap, and went and untied his mare and clumb up slow and
						stiff, like old men do, and rid away.

					<head>Story, Excerpt 4</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">Pap put down the froe and maul and laid the three wedges
						in a neat row on the ground and taken up the ax.<lb/> "Well, men," he said,
						"let's get started. We're already late."<lb/> "Me and Homer ain't," Solon said.
						"We was here." This time him and Homer didn't set on the cuts. They squatted
						on their heels. Then I seen that Homer was whittling on a stick. I hadn't
						noticed it before. "I make it two hours and a little over," Solon said.
						"More or less."<lb/> Pap was still about half stooped over, holding the ax. "It's
						nigher one," he said. "But call it two for the sake of the argument. What
						about it?"<lb/>
						"What argument?" Homer said. <lb/>
						"All right," pap said. "Two hours
						then. What about it?"<lb/>
						"Which is three man-hour units a hour, multiplied by
						two hours," Solon said. "Or a total of six work units." When the WPA first
						come to Yoknapatawpha County and started to giving out jobs and grub and
						mattresses, Solon went in to Jefferson to get on it. He would drive his
						school-bus truck the twenty-two miles in to town every morning and come back
						that night. He done that for almost a week before he found out he would not
						only have to sign his farm off into somebody else's name, he couldn't even
						own and run the school bus that he had built himself. So he come back that
						night and never went back no more, and since then hadn't nobody better
						mention WP and A to him unless they aimed to fight, too, though every now and
						then he would turn up with something all figured down into work units like
						he done now. "Six units short."

					<head>Story, Excerpt 5</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">"Four of which you and Homer could have already worked
						out while you was setting here waiting on me," pap said.<lb/>
						"Except that we
						didn't," Solon said. "We promised Whitfield two units of twelve three-unit
						hours toward getting some new shingles on the church roof. We been here ever
						since sunup, waiting for the third unit to show up, so we could start. You
						don't seem to kept up with these modern ideas about work that's been
						flooding and uplifting the country in the last few years."<lb/>
						"What modren
						ideas?" pap said. "I didn't know there was but one idea about work—until it
						is done, it ain't done, and when it is done, it is."<lb/>
						Homer made another
						long, steady whittle on the stick. His knife was sharp as a razor.<lb/>
						Solon
						taken out his snuffbox and filled the top and tilted the snuff into his lip
						and offered the box to Homer, and Homer shaken his head, and Solon put the
						top back on the box and put the box back into his pocket.<lb/>
						"So," pap said,
						"jest because I had to wait two hours for a old seventy-year man to get back
						from fox hunting that never had no more business setting out in the woods
						all night than he would 'a' had setting all night in a highway juke joint,
						we all three have got to come back here tomorrow to finish them two hours
						that vou and Homer — "<lb/>
						"I ain't," Solon said. "I don't know about Homer. I
						promised Whitfield one day. I was here at sunup to start it. When the sun
						goes down, I will consider I have done finished it."

					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">"I see," pap said. "I see. It's me that's got to come
						back. By myself. I got to break into a full morning to make up them two
						hours that you and Homer spent resting. I got to spend two hours of the next
						day making up for the two hours of the day before that you and Homer never
						even worked."<lb/>
						"It's going to more than jest break into a morning," Solon
						said. "It's going to wreck it. There's six units left over. Six one-man-hour
						units. Maybe you can work twice as fast as me and Homer put together and
						finish them in four hours, but I don't believe you can work three times as
						fast and finish in two."

					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction"> "Maybe there's something else besides cash you might be
						able to trade with," Solon said. "You might use that dog." That was when pap
						actually stopped. I didn't know it myself then either, but I found out a
						good long time before Solon did. Pap set there with the maul up over his
						head and the blade of the froe set against the block for the next lick,
						looking up at Solon. "The dog?" he said.<lb/>
						It was a kind of mixed hound, with
						a little bird dog and some collie and maybe a considerable of almost
						anything else, but it would ease through the woods without no more noise
						than a hant and pick up a squirrel's trail on the ground and bark jest once,
						unless it knowed you was where you could see it, and then tiptoe that trail
						out jest like a man and never make another sound until it treed, and only
						then when it knowed you hadn't kept in sight of it. It belonged to pap and
						Vernon Tull together. Will Varner give it to Tull as a puppy, and pap raised
						it for a half interest; me and him trained it and it slept in my bed with me
						until it got so big maw finally run it out of the house, and for the last
						six months Solon had been trying to buy it. Him and Tull had agreed on two
						dollars for Tull's half of it, but Solon and pap was still six dollars apart
						on ourn, because pap said it was worth ten dollars of anybody's money and if
						Tull wasn't going to collect his half of that, he was going to collect
						it for him.

					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">"So that's it," pap said. "Them things wasn't work units
						atall. They was dog units." <event desc="audience laughter"/><lb/> 
						"Jest a suggestion," Solon said. "Jest a
						friendly offer to keep them runaway shingles from breaking up your private
						business for six hours tomorrow morning. You sell me your half of that trick
						overgrown fyce and I'll finish these shingles for you."<lb/> 
						"Naturally including
						them six extra units of one dollars," pap said.<lb/>
						"No, no," Solon said. "I'll
						pay you the same two dollars for your half of that dog that me and Tull
						agreed on for his half of it. You meet me here tomorrow morning with the dog
						and you can go on back home or wherever them urgent private affairs are
						located, and forget about that church roof."

				<div2 type="reading" id="wfaudio07_1.10" start="00:09:51.35" end="00:11:02.27">
					<head>Story, Excerpt 9</head>
					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction">"Your half of the dog for that half a day's work you
						still owe on them shingles."<lb/>
						"And the two dollars," pap said. "That you and
						Tull agreed on. I sell you half the dog for two dollars, and you come back
						here tomorrow and finish the shingles. You give me the two dollars now, and
						I'll meet you here in the morning with the dog, and you can show me the
						receipt from Tull for his half then."<lb/> "Me and Tull have already agreed,"
						Solon said.<lb/>
						"All right," pap said. "Then you can pay Tull his two dollars
						and bring his receipt with you without no trouble."<lb/>
						"Tull will be at the
						church tomorrow morning, pulling off them old shingles," Solon said.<lb/>
						"All
						right," pap said. "Then it won't be no trouble at all for you to get a
						receipt from him. You can stop at the church when you pass. Tull ain't named
						Grier. He won't need to be off somewhere tomorrow morning borrowing a crowbar."<lb/>
						So Solon
						taken out his purse and paid pap the two dollars and they went back to work.
						And now it looked like they really was trying to finish that afternoon, not
						jest Solon, but even Homer, that didn't even seem to be concerned in it nohow,
						and pap, that had already swapped a half a dog to get rid of whatever work
						Solon claimed would be left over. I quit trying to stay up with them; I jest
						stacked shingles.

					<writing type="fiction">Then Solon laid his froe and maul down. "Well, men," he
						said, "I don't know what you fellers think, but I consider this a day."<lb/>
						"All
						right," pap said. "You are the one to decide when to quit, since whatever
						elbow units you consider are going to be shy tomorrow will be yourn."<lb/>
						
						"That's a fact," Solon said. "And since I am giving a day and a half to the
						church instead of jest a day, like I started out doing, I reckon I better
						get on home and tend to a little of my own work." He picked up his froe and
						maul and ax and went to his truck and stood waiting for Homer to come and
						get in.<lb/>
						"I'll be here in the morning with the dog," pap said.

					<u who="WF">
					<writing type="fiction"> "Sholy," Solon said. It sounded like he had forgot
						about the dog, or that it wasn't no longer any importance. But he stood
						there again and looked hard and quiet at pap for about a second. "And a bill
						of sale from Tull for his half of it. As you say, it won't be no trouble
						a-tall to get that from him." Him and Homer got into the truck and he
						started the engine. You couldn't say jest what it was. It was almost like
						Solon was hurrying himself, so pap wouldn't have to make any excuse or
						pretense toward doing or not doing anything. "I have always understood the
						fact that lightning don't have to hit twice is one of the reasons why they
						named it lightning. So getting lightning-struck is a mistake that might
						happen to any man. The mistake I seem to made is, I never realized in time
						that what I was looking at was a cloud. I'll see you in the morning."<lb/>
						"With
						the dog," pap said.<lb/>
						"Certainly," Solon said, again like it had slipped his
						mind completely. "With the dog."

					<writing type="fiction">Then him and Homer drove off. Then pap got up.<lb/>
						"What?" I
						said. "What? You swapped him your half of Tull's dog for that half a day's
						work tomorrow. Now what?"<lb/>
						"Yes," pap said. "Only before that I had already
						swapped Tull a half a day's work pulling off them old shingles tomorrow, for
						Tull's half of that dog. Only we ain't got to wait until tomorrow. We're
						going to pull them shingles off tonight, and without no more racket about it
						than is necessary. I don't aim to have nothing on my mind tomorrow but
						watching Mr. Solon Work-Unit Quick trying to get a bill of sale for two
						dollars or ten dollars either on the other half of that dog. And we'll do it
						tonight. I don't want him jest to find out at sunup tomorrow that he is too
						late. I want him to find out then that even when he had laid down to sleep he
						was already too late." <event desc="audience laughter"/>

						But of all places in the world and doing what under the sun with it, Old Man
						Killegrew had went and lost his crowbar out of a boat in forty feet of
						water. And pap said how he come within a inch of going to Solon's and
						borrowing his crowbar out of pure poetic justice, <event desc="audience laughter"/> only Solon might have
						smelled the rat jest from the idea of the crowbar. So pap went to Armstid's

					<writing type="fiction">We left her still talking, even as far as the front
						gate, and come on back to the church, walking this time, with the rope and
						crowbar and a hammer for me, and the lantern still dark. Whitfield and
						Snopes was unloading a ladder from Snopes' wagon when we passed the church
						on the way home before dark, so all we had to do was to set the ladder up
						against the church. Then pap clumb up onto the roof with the lantern and
						pulled off shingles until he could hang the lantern inside behind the
						decking, where it could shine out through the cracks in the planks, but you
						couldn't see it unless you was passing in the road, and by that time anybody
						would 'a' already heard us. Then I clumb up with the rope, and pap reached it
						through the decking and around a rafter and back and tied the ends around
						our waists, and we started. And we went at it. We had them old shingles jest
						raining down, me using the claw hammer and pap using- the crowbar, working
						the bar under a whole patch of shingles at one time and then laying back on
						the bar like in one more lick or if—or if the crowbar ever happened for one second
						to get a solid holt, he would tilt the whole roof up at one time like a
						hinged box lid.<lb/>
						That's exactly what he finally done, he laid back on the bar
						and this time he—it got a holt. It wasn't jest a patch of shingles, it was a
						whole section of decking, so that when he lunged back he snatched that whole
						section of roof from around the lantern like you would shuck a corn nubbin.
						The lantern was hanging on a nail. He never even moved the nail, he jest
						pulled the board off of it, so that it looked like for a whole minute I
						watched the lantern, and the crowbar, too, setting there in the empty air in
						a little mess of floating shingles, <event desc="audience laughter"/> with the empty nail still sticking
						through the bail of the lantern, before the whole thing started down into
						the church. It hit the floor and bounced once. Then it hit the floor again,
						and this time the whole church jest blowed up into a pit of yellow jumping
						fire, with me and pap hanging over the edge of it on two ropes.

						Armstid was there then; he had happened to go out to his lot about a hour
						back and seen the lantern on the church roof, and it stayed on his mind
						until finally he come up to see what was going on, and got there jest in
						time to stand yelling back and forth with pap across the water barrel. And I
						believe we still would have put it out. Pap turned and squatted against the
						barrel and got a holt of it over his shoulder and stood up with that barrel

					like Popeye or Joe Christmas or even Benjy, making them at other times
					Madonna-like, such as the woman in <hi rend="italic">Sanctuary</hi>, and at
					other times Judas-like, such as Lucas Burch in <hi rend="italic">Light in
						August</hi>?</u>
				<u who="WF">I think a writer has to write out of his—his experience, his background.
					He also has a sort of lumber room, like the carpenter has a—a lumber room, a room
					full of scraps of boards, of this and that, and when he finds that he needs
					something to tell the story he's trying to tell, he looks around in the lumber
					room, and he finds a board that—that he can use.  And since my past is a—or my
					background is a Christian background, my education is the normal education,
					full of the Christian symbols, I use them as the carpenter uses the boards that
					fit the job. I'm not trying to write about symbols at all. I'm writing about
					people, but I use these symbols simply because they're shortcuts to help me tell
					the story I'm trying to tell.

					trying to satirize my country. I love it, and it has its faults, and I will try

					human being that—that is alive, that will stand up and cast a shadow behind him,

					 that you think a <unclear>beginning</unclear> writer should have, a young
					writer should have.</u>
				<u who="WF">The first thing to do, I think, is to read, to read and to read and to
					read. As I say, the—the—the writer has got to have a lumber room like the
					carpenter, and the best lumber room he can have is the—the—the good books, to
					read and to read and to read. The—the next thing is to—to watch people, to try
					to understand why people do what they do, whether the—the motives are good
					motives or base motives, to understand, to not judge their motives, just to
					understand them, and then to work. I think if the young writer can—can follow
					those three rules, he can make his own rules <unclear>that</unclear> suit his
					particular case as he goes along, but they are good general rules I think for a

				<u who="WF">By the good books, I mean the books that have—people still read a

						would be what we call the classics. There are good books printed
					today, but I—I meant only books that people have still read enough, so that they

					books themselves are good. It means that they were good enough that people still

					That means to—to—to wonder, to—to speculate always why people do what they do,
					and you've got to get inside people. You've got to love people at the same time
					that you hate people to do that. You can't be on the outside. Then you're just

					foreknowledge of death. That is, he will have only a—a very short time
					comparatively to—to do the work, and he is trying to put the whole history of
					the human heart on the head of a pin, you might say. Also, to me, no man is
					himself. He is the sum of his past. There's no such thing really as "was,"
					because the past is. It is a part of—of—of every man, every woman, and every
					moment. All of his and her ancestry, background, is all a part of him—of himself and
					herself, at any moment. And so a man, a—a character in a story, at any moment of
					action, is not just himself as he is then. He is all that made him — <event desc="end of recording"/></u></div2>
