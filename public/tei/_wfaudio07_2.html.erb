  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong> and the long sentence is an attempt to get his past and possibly
                    his future into the instant in which he does something. But to me, what he does
                    is&#x2014;is not quite as important as who he is, the fact that he is a
                    continuity, that he has come a long way, that he has endured and he is, I hope,
                    we hope, better than&#x2014;than his ancestors were, that he's more
                    compassionate. He's more tolerant. We hope braver, more honest.
                    </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.2">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, a few weeks ago the Richmond papers quoted you as having
                    organized <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[in ascending order of excellence]</span>  <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[American]</span> writers
                        <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[you admire]</span>. Would you be willing to suggest what the
                    criterion was, ?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>The criterion was failure. My feeling is that we all fail, that none of
                    it is as good as we all wanted it to be. None of my stuff is as good as I wanted
                    it to be. That's why I keep on writing another one, and so I
                       rated these people only by what I called the splendor of
                    the failure. The one that made the most magnificent failure I rated first,
                        <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> not by the&#x2014;the value
                        that they did but by the splendor of the failure,
                    the&#x2014;the ambition, the aspiration to do more than&#x2014;than maybe
                    a human being can do, because you don't want to be better than&#x2014;than
                    your&#x2014;your fellow writer. You want to be as good as anybody that ever
                    did write. You want to be as good as <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Dante]</span> and Homer and Shakespeare and you can't,
                    you fail, so you write another book. If you ever did that one time, then there'd
                    be nothing left for you to do. You'd have to pick up&#x2014;take up a new
                        trade.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.3">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Yes, ma'am.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Well, this is more or less a question of fact. In <em>The
                        Sound and the Fury</em>, was Jason Compson, did you&#x2014;was he a
                    bastard?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, no, not a&#x2014;not an actual one, only but&#x2014;in
                    behavior. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.4">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Joseph Blotner:</strong>Do you find that it's easier to&#x2014;to write this&#x2014;this wonderful
                        rolling rhetoric of yours than it is to&#x2014;to
                        write a&#x2014;a completely objective scene?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>For me, it is. I'm too busy trying to make my people come to life and
                    then I run behind them at full speed trying to keep up with them <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> and I put down the best I can. I don't have time
                    to&#x2014;to think about style. I&#x2014;I believe that anyone who spends
                    too much time on style hasn't got a great deal to say. That if you have a lot to
                    say, you don't have time to think of style. You wish you could think of style
                    and&#x2014;and think of the material, too, but I don't believe that anyone
                    can.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.5">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner&#x2014;oh, I'm sorry.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>In connection with that, do you revise much?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I revise a great deal. I'm lazy&#x2014;I don't like the&#x2014;the
                    mechanics of&#x2014;of getting the words onto the paper. I will put that off
                    as long as possible, so a lot of the revision is done here. Until I can't put
                    off writing anymore, then I begin to put it down, and if it's not right, then I
                    rewrite and I rewrite and I rewrite until it's the best I can do.  But I won't
                    rewrite if I can help it. I like to get it all done so the first one
                    is&#x2014;will do, <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[because I'm lazy]</span>.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.6">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes'm.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, what do you consider your own most splendid failure, 
                    <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[if you could tell us]</span>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong><em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, because I worked at it the
                    longest and the hardest.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.7">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>In that connection, did you write it in the order in which it was
                    published?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>It was written in that order?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes. I wrote the Benjy part first. That wasn't good enough, so I wrote
                    the Quentin part. That still wasn't good enough. I let Jason try it. That still
                    wasn't enough. I let Faulkner try it, and that still wasn't enough, <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> and so about twenty years afterwards I wrote an
                    appendix still trying to make that book what&#x2014;match the
                        dream.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.8">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, I once read an article in which the writer speaking of the
                    end of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, said that the whole
                    pattern of the book does not become apparent until the very end, in the incident
                    in which Benjy begins to cry and blubber when they go left around the monument
                    and must turn to the right. Now, while I think that simply confirms everything
                    that has gone before, did you intend that as the moment of revelation?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, sir, I did not. I was still&#x2014;as I've just said, I was still
                    trying to tell that story. In the first section, I hadn't told it. I had to try
                    again. I had to try three, four times.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I've always been afraid it was something I missed in the ending. I'm glad
                    to have you confirm that. <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Thank you.]</span><span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.14">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner&#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>You say you write because you have a story to tell, and you try to tell
                    it in the best way. How do you conceive these stories? Which comes first?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>It's the people. Suddenly people are doing something that
                    is&#x2014;is tragic or funny, or something brave, 
                    of&#x2014;of sacrifice that seems to me moving enough to be worth telling,
                    and then after that it's a matter of&#x2014;of invention to&#x2014;to
                    tell the story.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Well, how do you get the basic idea? I mean&#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I don't know where it comes from.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.9">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, are you conscious of any way or theme, any attempt that you
                    have more frequently , something that turned out to be a dead-end or a
                    blind alley, and then did you put that in <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[terms]</span> some other
                    way?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir, that's a&#x2014;a matter of&#x2014;of so much&#x2014;as much of
                    that as possible is done up here. I have&#x2014;have written three
                    manuscripts that never did quite please me, and I burned them up. But
                    it's&#x2014;you try, and you try, and you try to do the best you can, to make
                    something which&#x2014;which to you was&#x2014;was passionate and moving,
                    so passionate and moving that it wouldn't let you alone. You had to write it.
                    And then you&#x2014;you do the best you can to make it as passionate and
                    moving to anyone who reads it as it was to you, because it seems worthwhile,
                    worth doing.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Why do you suppose that it didn't work out in those three books?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>It could be that I didn't know enough. It could be that the people were
                    not good enough people. That they&#x2014;they never did&#x2014;they
                    never&#x2014;the books, the manuscripts, were never good enough for me to
                    pass them, so I just put them in the fire and got rid of them.
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.10">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>You once disinherited <em>Sanctuary</em> in the preface I
                    think to the Modern Library edition by saying it was a book written strictly for
                    money and that you hoped to make it as sensational as
                        possible If this is so, sir, why did you write a sequel
                    to it in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, I wrote that book to make a little money. I sent it to the
                    publisher, and he said, "Good, Lord, we all&#x2014;we'll both be in jail if
                    we print this," <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> so I forgot about it. I wrote
                    two more books. They were printed. And then one day I got the galleys for
                    <em>Sanctuary,</em> and I read them and it was so bad, so
                        basely conceived, that I wrote the publisher to let's
                    destroy it, and he said, "I have had the plates made. I have invested money in
                    it." At that time, he didn't have a great deal of money either, and I said,
                    "Well, it's&#x2014;I can't pass it like this, so I'll rewrite it." And he said,
                    "All right, but you rewrite it then and&#x2014;and I'll pay half the new plates, 
                    and you pay half the new plates," so I said "All right." So I rewrote the book and
                    made the best I could out of&#x2014;out of the&#x2014;the first base
                    story, and that cost me&#x2014;my share of the plates was two hundred and
                    seventy dollars at a time when I didn't have two hundred and seventy dollars. I
                    got a job <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[passing]</span> coal at a power plant to earn my share. The book sold. The
                    first money I was to have, sixty-five hundred dollars, and the publisher went
                    broke, and I didn't get that, which served me exactly right. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>
                </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.11">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes,
                    sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, do you think that man is getting better and better every day in
                    every way?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I think that&#x2014;<span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> I think that
                    man tries to be better than he thinks he will be. I think that that is his
                    immortality, that he wants to be better, he wants to be braver, he wants to be
                    more honest than he thinks he will be, and sometimes he's not, but then
                    suddenly, to his own astonishment, he is.

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes,

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>In reference to <em>Sanctuary</em>, when you were writing
                    this, did you have in mind anything like the rape of the
                        South?  I mean, there's been a lot of talk about that. Did you have
                    that in mind when you wrote &#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No&#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Either time?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No. I was simply writing a story which I thought somebody might pay some
                    money for.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>The first instance?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, and the second time I was trying to make the best I could out of
                    something that was going to cost me two hundred and seventy dollars. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>

  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.13">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>When you wrote the <em>Fable</em> and moved over to a different
                     background, what did you have in mind as a bigger success
                    than you had had before in your Mississippi background?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>That was the only book I ever wrote from an idea, and the idea struck
                    me, who might the soldier really be under the splendid cenotaph with the eternal
                    fire burning over it. Suppose that had been Christ? Suppose he had come back and
                    had been crucified for the second time. We might not have but one more chance.
                    That came from an idea. That was the only book that was ever written from a
                    simple idea. The others have come from my own people.</p>

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Young Gerald here was struck by what you said about good people and wants
                    me to ask you what you mean by good people.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I mean that&#x2014;that people want to be better than they are. I
                    believe that all people want to be better than they are, want to be more honest
                    and more compassionate. I think that's the only reason the human race
                    has&#x2014;has lasted as long as it has, because it does want to be better
                    than it is, that individual people want to be better than they are afraid they
                    are, and they do try, and they fail, but then suddenly, when nobody expects it,
                    they are better.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Then may I ask if all of these characters in <em>The Sound
                        and the Fury</em>&#x2014;that you would call them "good people"?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I would call them tragic people. The&#x2014;the good people, Dilsey,
                    the Negro woman, she was a good human being. That she held that family together
                    for not the hope of reward, but just because it was the decent and proper thing
                    to do.</p>

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Do you think people are good because they want to be better or because
                    ?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, that can&#x2014;it can be any number of personal reasons why
                    the individual wants to be better, but I think that in&#x2014;in general, man
                    wants to be better than he is, that he doesn't want to be cruel, that he would
                    like to get rid of&#x2014;of grief if he just knew how to, if he was just
                    wise enough. He would like to get rid of war, for instance, if he just knew how
                    or just wise enough, to get rid of greed if he just knew how.</p>

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I'm sorry. I couldn't hear.</p>

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Determines his behavior, yes. Not his goodness, but his behavior. His
                    goodness is&#x2014;I like to believe, is a constant factor, but he can't
                    always match it, but he wants to be better than he is, than he's afraid he might
                    be, and he tries.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio07_2.17">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, you indicated before that <em>A Fable</em> was a
                        departure in that&#x2014;insofar that it was the only book written from a&#x2014;an absolute
                        idea, with&#x2014;with regular city limits to it. But I find&#x2014;at least, I find,
                        that the&#x2014;the basic crucifixion image in <em>A Fable</em> occurs over
                    and over again in your books. It occurs in <em>Light in
                        August</em>. It happens in a kind of way even in&#x2014;in <em>Sanctuary. </em>It happens in <em>Requiem for a
                        Nun</em>, certainly, with&#x2014;with Nancy. Isn't <em>A
                        Fable</em> simply a more positive way of approaching the problem?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>As a result, it might be. Remember, the writer must write out of his
                    background. He must write out of what he knows, and the Christian legend is a
                    part of&#x2014;of any Christian's background, especially the background of
                    a&#x2014;of a&#x2014;of a country boy, a southern country boy. My life was
                    passed, my childhood, in a&#x2014;a very small Mississippi town, and that was
                    a part of my background. I grew up with that. I assimilated that, took that in
                    without even knowing it. It's just&#x2014;just there. It has nothing to do
                    with how much of it I might believe or disbelieve. It's just there.

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Let me understand you. The story that I think of is more real than the

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>At the moment, I'm completely demon-ridden to get that story written,
                    that nothing else matters. It's not that the world is not there
                    anymore. It's just that I'm too busy getting&#x2014;getting my story done to

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Conrad Aiken once said that after he had written a story, the story then
                    seemed perhaps more real than the things which had happened, and that as he
                    thought back on it, he felt that the thing that he had written was what had
                    happened in his life as it had, as opposed to the actual fact. Do you find that

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, I don't. That's Mr. Aiken's own point of view. That's not mine too
                    much. That my&#x2014;my people are&#x2014;are&#x2014;are no more real
                    than the actual world, but no less real. That is, they have their place

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Is it possible that you project onto your characters a greater
                    sophistication than they have?  As I know that type of person, it seems to me that
                    they're not quite as sophisticated as&#x2014;for example, the Christian myth
                    as they understand it, doesn't seem to me to be quite

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>The writer is not a reporter. He is using his imagination, his
                    observation, his experience and, of course, his own warped ideas
                    without&#x2014;not deliberately, but he can't help it. It's a part of
                    his&#x2014;his background, a part of his workshop, and possibly they are more
                    sophisticated than&#x2014;as I write them, than they are as they live
                    in&#x2014;in the world. I&#x2014;I'm still trying to tell a story. I use
                    the material which seems to me to tell the story best, and it's not any
                    deliberate intent to make these people more sophisticated than they are. It
                    seems to me&#x2014;seems that is the best way to tell the story I'm trying to

                    outside, or from a&#x2014;a greater power than he, but the&#x2014;the
                    desire to be better than he is afraid he might be is inside him, inside his
                    conscience, unless he is an idiot, of course.

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, you&#x2014;the book of yours which troubles me most,
                    is&#x2014;puzzles me most, doesn't trouble me at all, is <em>As I Lay Dying</em>. Somebody once suggested to me that the&#x2014;I

                    the separate parts of just one man. Is this so?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, they were&#x2014;I was&#x2014;I was writing about people
                    again. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> I took these people, and
                    that&#x2014;that's a simple <em>tour de force</em>. I took this
                    family and subjected them to the two greatest catastrophes which&#x2014;which
                    man can suffer&#x2014;flood and fire. That's all. That was simple <em>tour de
                    force</em>. That was written in six weeks without changing a word because I knew from

  <a name="wfaudio07_2.23">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, in <em>A Fable</em> and in some other places,
                    you used the term "prevail" as over against the word "endure." Could you spell

                    the use of that term "prevail"?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I believe that in time man will&#x2014;will get rid of war, just as
                    he has got rid of&#x2014;of other evils. Little children don't have to work
                    any longer. A man can no longer have his hand chopped off for stealing a loaf of
                    bread, that a&#x2014;a lot has been done to&#x2014;to get rid of poverty
                    and hunger and misery.  And in that way, man prevails. I&#x2014;how far he can
                    go before through some of his own fault he eradicates himself from the face of
                    the earth, I don't know, but he tries to improve his condition and
                        does.

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>The title, of course, came from the first section, which was Benjy. I

                    it&#x2014;in that sense it does apply to Benjy rather than to anybody

                    Russians and Chinese. That I'm simply using the&#x2014;the background, the

                    with, but the people in my opinion are not that different. They could be
                    anywhere. Of course they would wear different clothes, and their behavior might
                    be a little awry from what it is in north Mississippi, but the behavior would be
                    the same. They would have the same anguishes, the same hopes, and
                    they&#x2014;Russians or Chinese&#x2014;would still want to be better than

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>What is the meaning of the title "A Rose for Emily"?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Oh, it's simply the poor woman had had no life at all. Her father had
                    kept her more or less locked up, and then she had a lover, and he was about to quit
                    her. She had to murder him. It was just "A Rose for Emily," that's all. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Does your criterion <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[apply, to say, the great writers of the
                        past]</span>
                    ?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No'm, the&#x2014;the criterion for judging the&#x2014;the writing of
                    the past is the ones that I like to read, that I will read again and again and
                    again. I&#x2014;I don't know of any writer of the present who&#x2014;whose
                    work I will read again and again and again, as I will read Cervantes, for
                    instance, or Dickens.

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, ma'am.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, don't you believe that in a few hundred years, say, that
                    there will be books produced, that were produced in this century, that will be
                    read over and over again as Dickens <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[is read today]</span>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Now that I can't say, for the reason that the writer is really too
                    busy with his own work to have much time to read what anybody else does, so I
                    just don't know really what people are writing today. I do&#x2014;do know
                    that what I write ain't as good as I want it to be, <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> and so I'm going to keep on trying to write one
                    that will suit me. I probably won't, but I intend to keep on trying.

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, ma'am.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I've read and also I've heard the poet John <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Neihardt]</span> say that you have to
                    make yourself sit there and write something every day, that that's the way to do
                    it, <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[whether it's]</span>  or not .  How much is inspiration and 
                    how much is perspiration?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I&#x2014;that system works with lots of people, but not with me. I
                    never had any trouble writing the stuff. It's persuading myself to sit down and
                    do it. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> Some people, that sort of
                     discipline works with, but&#x2014;but with others,
                    it&#x2014;it don't. With me, it never would, that I put off writing as long
                    as possible and then when I get started, I can write for ten or twelve hours
                    day after day until I get  until I get&#x2014;</p>

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Strictly as a matter of your choice of forms, do
                    you ever find yourself beginning a short story that suddenly blossoms or has to
                    blossom into a novel, or <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[vice versa]</span>?</p>

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong> <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Yes, sir]</span>

  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Or can you cite from the novels that&#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong><em>The Sound and the Fury</em> started as a short story.
                    I thought it could be done in ten pages. Then I had written a hundred pages, and
                    that wasn't enough. I wrote another hundred. That wasn't enough. Another
                    hundred. That still wasn't enough.

  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes,

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, a great many of the people that Tennessee Williams writes about are
                    southerners. What is your opinion of these people <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[that he writes
                        about]</span>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, the&#x2014;I couldn't have any opinion of the people that he
                    writes about. I could have an opinion of the&#x2014;of the complete job
                    that's done. The best of&#x2014;of Williams, to me, was a play called <em>Camino Real</em>. I think <em>Cat on a Hot Tin
                        Roof</em> was written about the wrong people. The story was the old man's
                    story. I think that the anguishes of children ain't worth three acts. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some end of recording happening">[end of recording]</span></p>
