						<writing type="fiction">When the Texan, picking his teeth with a splintered
							kitchen match, emerged from the house twenty minutes later, the tethered
							wagons and riding horses and mules extended from the lot gate to
							Varner's store, and there were more than fifty men now standing along
							the fence beside the gate, watching him quietly, a little covertly, as
							he approached, rolling a little, slightly bowlegged, the high heels of
							his carved boots printing neatly into the dust. "Morning, gents," he
							said. "Here, bud," he said to the little boy, who stood slightly behind
							him, looking at the protruding butt of the pistol. He took a coin from
							his pocket and gave it to the boy. "Run to the store and get me a box of
							gingersnaps." He looked about at the quiet faces, protuberant, sucking
							his teeth. He rolled the match from one side of his mouth to the other
							without touching it. "You boys done made your picks, have you? Ready to
							start her off, hah?" They didn't answer. They were not looking at him
							now. That is, he began to have the feeling that each face had stopped
							looking at him the second before his gaze reached it. After a moment
							Freeman said:<lb/>
							"Aint you going to wait for Flem?" <lb/>
							"Why?" the Texan said. Then Freeman stopped looking
							at him too. There was nothing in Freeman's face either. There was
							nothing, no alteration, in the Texan's voice. "Eck, you done already
							picked out yours. So we can start her off when you are ready." "I reckon
							not," Eck said.<lb/> "I wouldn't buy nothing I was afraid to walk up and
							touch."<lb/> "Them little ponies?" the Texan said. "You helped water and feed
							them. I bet that boy of yours could walk up to any one of them."<lb/> "He
							better not let me catch him at it," Eck said. The Texan looked about at the
							quiet faces, his gaze at once abstract and alert, with an impenetrable
							surface quality like flint, as though the surface were impervious or
							perhaps there was nothing behind it.<lb/>
							"Them ponies is gentle as a dove, boys. The man that
							buys them will get the best piece of horseflesh he ever forked or druv
							for the money. Naturally they got spirit; I aint selling crowbait.
							Besides, who'd want Texas crowbait anyway, with Mississippi full of it?"
								<event desc="audience laughter"/> His stare was still absent and
							unwinking; there was no mirth or humor in his voice and there was
							neither mirth nor humor in the single guffaw which came from the rear of
							the group. Two wagons were now drawing out of the road at the same time,
							up to the fence. The men got down from them and tied them to the fence
							and approached. "Come up, boys," the Texan said. "You're just in time to
							buy a good gentle horse cheap." <lb/>
							"How about that one that cut your vest off night before 
							last?" a voice said. This time three or four guffawed. The Texan looked
							toward the sound, bleak and unwinking.<lb/>
							"What about it?" he said. The
							laughter, if it had been laughter, ceased. The Texan turned to the
							nearest gatepost and climbed to the top of it, his alternate thighs
							deliberate and bulging in his tight trousers, the butt of the pistol
							catching and losing the sun in pearly gleams. Sitting on the post, he
							looked down at the faces along the fence which were attentive, grave,
							reserved and not looking at him. "All right," he said. "Who's going to
							start her off with a bid? Step right up; take your pick and make your
							bid, and when the last one is sold, walk in that lot and put your rope
							on the best piece of horseflesh you ever forked or druv for the money.
							There aint a pony there that aint worth fifteen dollars. Young, sound,
							good for saddle or work stock, guaranteed to outlast four ordinary
							horses; you couldn't kill one of them with a axle-tree—" There was a
							small violent commotion at the rear of the group. The little boy
							appeared, burrowing among the motionless overalls. He approached the
							post, the new and unbroken paper carton lifted. The Texan leaned down
							and took it and tore the end from it and shook three or four of the
							cakes into the boy's hands, a hand as small and almost as black as that
							of a coon. He held the carton in his hand while he talked, pointing out
							the horses with it as he indicated them. "Look at that one with the
							three stocking-feet and the frost-bit ear; watch him now when they pass
							again. Look at that shoulder-action; that horse is worth twenty dollars
							of any man's money. Who'll make me a bid on him to start her off?" His
							voice was harsh, ready, forensic. Along the fence below him the men
							stood with, buttoned close in their overalls, the tobacco-sacks and worn
							purses, the sparse silver and frayed bills hoarded a coin at a time in
							the cracks of chimneys or chinked into the logs of walls. From time to
							time the horses broke and rushed with purposeless violence and huddled
							again, watching the faces along the fence with wild mismatched eyes. The
							lane was full of wagons now. As the others arrived they would have to
							stop in the road beyond it and the occupants came up the lane on foot.
							Mrs Littlejohn came out of her kitchen. She crossed the yard, looking
							toward the lot gate. There was a blackened wash pot set on four bricks
							in the corner of the yard. She built a fire beneath the pot and came to
							the fence and stood there for a time, her hands on her hips and the
							smoke from the fire drifting blue and slow behind her. Then she turned
							and went back into the house. "Come on, boys," the Texan said. "Who'll
							make me a bid?" <lb/>
							"Four bits," a voice said. The Texan did not even
							glance toward it.<lb/>
							"Or, if he dont suit you, how about that fiddle-head
							horse without no mane to speak of? For a saddle pony, I'd rather have
							him than <unclear>this</unclear> stocking-foot. I heard somebody say fifty cents just now.
							I reckon he meant five dollars, didn't he? Do I hear five dollars?"<lb/>
							"Four bits for the lot," the same voice said. <event
								desc="audience laughter"/> This time there were no guffaws. It was
							the Texan who laughed, harshly, with only his lower face, as if he were
							reciting a multiplication table.<lb/> "Fifty cents for the dried mud offen
							them, he means," he said. "Who'll give a dollar more for the genuine
							Texas cockle-burrs?" Mrs Littlejohn came out of the kitchen, carrying
							the sawn half—half of a wooden hogshead which she set on a stump beside the
							smoking pot, and stood with her hands on her hips, looking into the lot
							for a while without coming to the fence this time. Then she went back
							into the house. "What's the matter with you boys?" the Texan said.
							"Here, Eck, you been helping me and you know them horses. How about
							making me a bid on that wall-eyed one you picked out last night? Here.
							Wait a minute." He thrust the paper carton into his other hip pocket and
							swung his feet inward and dropped, cat-light, into the lot. The ponies,
							huddled, watched him. Then they broke before him and slid stiffly along
							the fence. He turned them and they whirled and rushed back across the
							lot; whereupon, as though he had been waiting his chance when they
							should have turned their backs on him, the Texan began to run too, so
							that when they reached the opposite side of the lot and turned, slowing
							to huddle again, he was almost upon him—them. The earth became thunderous;
							dust arose, out of which the animals began to burst like flushed quail
							and into which, with that apparently unflagging faith in his own
							invulnerability, the Texan rushed. For an instant the watchers could see
							them in the dust—the pony backed into the angle of the fence and the
							stable, the man facing it, reaching toward his hip. Then the beast
							rushed at him in a sort of fatal and hopeless desperation and he struck
							it between the eyes with the pistol-butt and felled it and leaped upon
							its prone head. The pony recovered almost at once and pawed itself to
							its knees and heaved at its prisoned head and fought itself up, dragging
							the man with it; for an instant in the dust the watchers saw the man
							free of the earth and in violent lateral motion like a rag attached to
							the horse's head. Then the Texan's feet came back to earth and the dust
							blew aside and revealed them, motionless, the Texan's sharp heels braced
							into the ground, one hand gripping the pony's forelock and the other its
							nostrils, the long evil muzzle wrung backward over its scarred shoulder
							while it breathed in labored and hollow groans.<lb/>
							Mrs Littlejohn was in the yard again. No one had
							seen her emerge this time. She carried an armful of clothing and a
							metal-ridged washboard and she was standing motionless at the kitchen
							steps, looking into the lot. Then she moved across the yard, still
							looking into the lot, and dumped the garments into the tub, still
							looking into the lot. "Look him over, boys," the Texan panted, turning
							his own suffused face and the protuberant glare of his eyes toward the
							fence. "Look him over quick. Them shoulders and—" He had relaxed for an
							instant apparently. The animal exploded again; again for an instant the
							Texan was free of the earth, though he was still talking: "—and legs you
							whoa I'll tear your face right look him over quick boys worth fifteen
							dollars of let me get a holt of who'll make me a bid whoa you blare-eyed
							jack rabbit, whoa!" <event desc="audience laughter"/> They were moving
							now—a kaleidoscope of inextricable and incredible violence on the
							periphery of which the metal clasps of the Texan's suspenders
							sun-glinted in ceaseless orbit, with terrific slowness across the lot.
							Then the broad clay-colored hat soared deliberately outward; an instant
							later the Texan followed it, though still on his feet, and the pony shot
							free in mad, staglike bounds. The Texan picked up the hat and struck the
							dust from it against his leg, and returned to the fence and mounted the
							post again. He was breathing heavily. Still the faces didn't look at
							him as he took the carton from his hip and shook a cake from it and put
							the cake into his mouth, chewing, breathing harshly. Mrs Littlejohn
							turned away and began to bail water from the pot into the tub, though
							after each bucketful she turned her head and looked into the lot again.
							"Now, boys," the Texan said. "Who says that pony aint worth fifteen
							dollars? You couldn't buy that much dynamite for just fifteen dollars.
								<event desc="audience laughter"/> There aint a one of them cant do a
							mile in three minutes; turn them into pasture and they will board
							themselves; work them like hell all day and every time you think about
							it, lay them over the head with a single-tree and after a couple of days
							every jack rabbit one of them will be as tame—so tame you will have to put them
							out of the house at night like a cat."  <event desc="audience laughter"/>  He shook another cake from the
							carton and ate it. "Come on, Eck," he said. "Start her off. How about
							ten dollars for that horse, Eck?"<lb/>
							"What need I got for a horse I wouldn't—I would need a
							bear-trap to catch?" Eck said.<lb/> "Didn't you just see me catch him?"<lb/> "I
							seen you," Eck said. "And I dont want nothing as big as a horse if I got
							to wrastle with it every time it finds me on the same side of a fence
							it's on."<lb/> "All right," the Texan said. He was still breathing harshly,
							but now there was nothing of fatigue or breathlessness in it. He shook
							another cake into his palm and inserted it beneath the moustache. "All
							right. I want to get this auction started. I aint come here to live, no
							matter how good a country you folks claim you got. I'm going to give you
							that horse." For a moment there was no sound, not even that of breathing
							except the Texan's.<lb/> "You going to give it to me?" Eck said.<lb/> "Yes.
							Provided you will start the bidding on the next one." Again there was no
							sound save the Texan's breathing, and then the clash of Mrs Littlejohn's
							pail against the rim of the pot.<lb/>
							"I just start the bidding," Eck said. "I dont have
							to buy it lessen I aint over-topped." Another wagon had come up to the
							lane. It was battered and paintless. One wheel had been repaired by
							crossed planks bound to the spokes with baling wire and the two underfed
							mules wore a battered harness patched with bits of cotton rope; the
							reins were ordinary cotton plow-lines, not new. It contained a woman in
							a shapeless gray garment and a faded sunbonnet, and a man in faded and
							patched though clean overalls. There was not room for the wagon to draw
							out of the lane so the man left it standing where it was and got down
							and came forward—a thin man, not large, with something about his eyes,
							something strained and washed-out, at once vague and intense, who shoved
							into the crowd at the rear, saying,<lb/> "What? What's that? Did he give him
							that horse?"<lb/> "All right," the Texan said. "That wall-eyed horse with the
							scarred neck belongs to you. Now. That one that looks like he's had his—had his
							head in a flour barrel. What do you say? Ten dollars?"<lb/>
							"Did he give him that horse—did he give him that horse?" the newcomer said.<lb/>
							"A
							dollar," Eck said. The Texan's mouth was still open for speech; for an
							instant his face died so behind his hard eyes.<lb/>
							"A dollar?" he said. "One
							dollar? Did I actually hear that?"<lb/> "Durn it," Eck said. "Two dollars
							then. But I aint—"<lb/>
							"Wait," the newcomer said. "You, up there on the
							post." The Texan looked at him. When the others turned, they saw that
							the woman had left the wagon too, though they had not known she was
							there until—since they had not seen the wagon drive up. She came among them
							behind the man, gaunt in the gray shapeless garment and the sunbonnet,
							wearing stained canvas gymnasium shoes. She overtook the man but she did
							not touch him, standing just behind him, her hands rolled before her
							into the gray dress.<lb/>
							"Henry," she said in a flat voice. The man looked
							over his shoulder.<lb/> 
							"Get back to that wagon," he said.<lb/>
							"Here, missus,"
							the Texan said. "Henry's going to get the bargain of his life in about a
							minute. Here, boys, let the missus come up close where she can see.
							Henry's going to pick out that saddle-horse the missus has been wanting.
							Who says ten—" <lb/>
							"Henry," the woman said. She didn't raise her
							voice. She had not once looked at the Texan. She touched the man's arm.
							He turned and struck her hand down.<lb/> 
							"Get back to that wagon like I told
							you." The woman stood behind him, her hands rolled again into her dress.
							She was not looking at anything, speaking to anyone.<lb/>
							"He aint no more
							despair than to buy one of them things," she said. "And us not but five
							dollars away from the poorhouse, he aint no more despair." The man
							turned upon her with that curious air of leashed, of dreamlike fury. The
							others lounged along the fence in attitudes gravely inattentive, almost
							oblivious. Mrs Littlejohn had been washing for some time now, pumping
							rhythmically up and down above the washboard in the sud-foamed tub. 
							Now she stood erect again, her soap-raw hands on her hips, looking into the
							lot.<lb/>
							"Shut your mouth and get back to that wagon," the man said. "Do you
							want me to take a wagon stake to you?" He turned and looked up at the
							Texan. "Did you give him that horse?" he said. The Texan was looking at
							the woman. Then he looked at the man; still watching him, he tilted the
							paper carton over his open palm. A single cake came out of it.<lb/>
							"Yes," he said. <lb/>
							"Is the fellow that bids in to this next horse going to
							get that first one too?"<lb/> "No," the Texan said.<lb/> 
							"All right," the other
							said. "Are you going to give a horse to the man that makes the first bid
							on the next one?"<lb/> 
							"No," the Texan said.<lb/> 
							"Then if you was just starting
							the auction off by giving away a horse, why didn't you wait till we were
							all here?" The Texan stopped looking at the other. He raised the empty
							carton and squinted carefully into it, as if it might contain a precious
							jewel or perhaps a deadly insect. Then he crumpled it and dropped it
							carefully beside the post on which he sat.<lb/>
							"Eck bids two dollars," he
							said. "I believe he still thinks he's bidding on them scraps of bob-wire
							they come here in instead of one of them horses. But I got to accept
							it. But are you boys—"<lb/>
							"So Eck's going to get two horses at a dollar a
							head," the newcomer said. "Three dollars." The woman touched him again.
							He flung her hand off without turning and she stood again, her hands
							rolled into her dress across her flat stomach, not looking at anything.<lb/>
							
							"Mister," she said, "we got chaps in the house that never had shoes
							last winter. We aint got corn to feed the stock. We got five dollars I
							earned weaving by firelight after dark. And he aint no more despair."<lb/>
							
							"Henry bids three dollars," the Texan said. "Raise him a dollar, Eck,
							and the horse is yours." Beyond the fence the horses rushed suddenly and
							for no reason and as suddenly stopped, staring at the faces along the
							fence. <lb/>
							"Henry," the woman said. The man was watching Eck.
							His stained and broken teeth showed a little beneath his lip. His wrists
							dangled into fists below the faded sleeves of his shirt too short from—from
							many washings.<lb/>
							"Four dollars," Eck said.<lb/>
							"Five dollars!" the husband
							said, raising one clenched hand. He shouldered himself forward toward
							the gatepost. The woman didn't follow him. She now looked at the Texan
							for the first time. Her eyes were a washed gray also, as though they had
							faded too like the dress and the sunbonnet.<lb/>
							"Mister," she said, "if you
							take that five dollars I earned my chaps a-weaving for one of them
							things, it'll be a curse on you and yours during all the time of man."<lb/>
							
							"Five dollars!" the husband shouted. He thrust himself up to the post,
							his clenched hand on a level with the Texan's knees. He opened it upon a
							wad of frayed banknotes and silver. "Five dollars! And the man that
							raises it will have to beat my head off or I'll beat hisn."<lb/>
							"All right,"
							the Texan said. "Five dollars is bid. But dont you shake your hand at
							me."<lb/>
							At five oclock that—that afternoon the Texan crumpled the
							third paper carton and dropped it to the earth beneath him. In the
							copper slant of the leveling sun which fell also upon the line of limp
							garments in Mrs Littlejohn's back yard and which cast his shadow and
							that of the post on which he sat long across the lot where now and then
							the ponies still rushed in purposeless and tireless surges, the Texan
							straightened his leg and thrust his hand into his pocket and took out a
							coin and leaned down to the little boy. His voice was now hoarse, spent.
							"Here, bud," he said. "Run to the store and get me a box of
							gingersnaps." The men still stood along the fence, tireless, in their
							overalls and faded shirts. Flem Snopes was there now, appeared—appeared suddenly
							from nowhere, standing beside the fence with a space the width of three
							or four men on either side of him, standing there in his small yet
							definite isolation, chewing tobacco, in the same gray trousers and
							minute bow tie in which he had departed last summer but in a new cap,
							gray too like the other, but new, and overlaid with a bright golfer's
							plaid, looking also at the horses in the lot. All of them two—save two had
							been sold for sums ranging from three dollars and a half to eleven and
							twelve dollars. The purchasers, as they had bid them in, had gathered as
							though by instinct into a separate group on the other side of the gate,
							where they stood with their hands lying upon the top strand of the
							fence, watching with a still more sober intensity the animals which some
							of them had owned for seven or eight hours now but had not yet laid
							hands upon. The husband, Henry, stood beside the post on which the Texan
							sat. The wife had gone back to the wagon, where she sat gray in the gray
							garment, motionless, looking at nothing still; she might have been
							something inanimate which he had loaded onto the wagon to move it
							somewhere, waiting now in the wagon until he should be ready to go on
							again, patient, insensate, timeless. <lb/>
							"I bought a horse and I paid cash for it," he said.
							His voice was harsh and spent too, the mad look in his eyes had—had a
							quality glazed now and even sightless. "And yet you expect me to stand
							around here till they are all sold before I can get my horse. Well, you
							can do all the expecting you want. I'm going to take my horse out of
							there and go home." The Texan looked down at him. The Texan's shirt was
							blotched with sweat. His big face was cold and still, his voice level.<lb/>
							
							"Take your horse then." After a moment Henry looked away. He stood with
							his head bent a little, swallowing from time to time.<lb/>
							"Aint you going to
							catch him for me?"<lb/>
							"It aint my horse," the Texan said in that flat still
							voice. After a while Henry raised his head. He didn't look at the
							Texan. <lb/>
							"Who'll help me catch my horse?" he said. Nobody
							answered. They stood along the fence, looking quietly into the lot where
							the ponies huddled, already beginning to fade a little where the long
							shadow of the house lay upon them, deepening. From Mrs Littlejohn's
							kitchen the smell of frying ham came. A noisy cloud of sparrows swept
							across the lot and into a chinaberry tree beside the house, and in the
							high soft vague blue swallows stooped and whirled in erratic indecision,
							their cries like strings plucked at random. Without looking back, Henry
							raised his voice: "Bring that ere plowline." After a while the wife
							moved. She got down from the wagon and took a coil of new cotton rope
							from it and approached. The husband took the rope from her and moved
							toward the gate. The Texan began to descend from the post, stiffly, as
							Henry put his hand on the latch. "Come on here," he said.  His wife had
							stopped when he took the rope from her. She moved again, obediently, her
							hands rolled into the dress across her stomach, passing the Texan
							without looking at him.<lb/>
							"Dont you go in there, missus," he said. She
							stopped, not looking at him, not looking at anything. The husband opened
							the gate and entered the lot and turned, holding the gate open but
							without raising his eyes.<lb/>
							"Come on here," he said.<lb/>
							"Dont you go in
							there, missus," the Texan said. The wife stood motionless between them,
							her face almost concealed by the sunbonnet, her hands folded across her
							stomach. <lb/>
							"I reckon I better," she said. The old—the other men did not
							look at her at all, at her or Henry either. They stood along the fence,
							grave and quiet and inattentive, almost bemused. Then the wife passed
							through the gate; the husband shut it behind them and turned and began
							to move toward the huddled ponies, the wife following in the gray and
							shapeless garment within which she moved without inference of
							locomotion, like something on a moving platform, a float. The horses
							were watching them. They clotted and blended and shifted among
							themselves, on the point of breaking though not breaking yet. The
							husband shouted at them. He began to curse them, advancing, the wife
							following. Then the huddle broke, the animals moving with high, stiff
							knees, circling the two people who turned and followed again as the herd
							flowed and huddled again at the opposite side of the lot.<lb/>
							"There he is," the husband said. "Get him into that
							corner." The herd divided; the horse which the husband had bought jolted
							on stiff legs. The wife shouted at it; it spun and poised, plunging,
							then the husband struck it across the face with the coiled rope and it
							whirled and slammed into the corner of the fence. "Keep it there now,"
							the husband said. He shook out the rope, advancing. The horse watched
							him shouted wild, glaring eyes; it rushed again, straight toward the
							wife.<lb/>
							She shouted at it and waved her arms but it soared past her in a
							long bound and rushed again into the huddle of its fellows. They
							followed and hemmed it again into the other corner; again the wife failed
							to stop its rush for freedom and the husband turned and struck her with
							the coiled rope. "Why didn't you head him?" he said. "Why didn't you?"
							He struck her again; she didn't move, not even to fend the rope with a
							raised arm. The men along the fence stood quietly, their faces lowered
							as though brooding upon the earth at their feet. Only Flem Snopes was
							still watching—if he ever had been looking into the lot at all, standing
							in a little island of isolation, chewing with his characteristic faint
							sidewise thrust beneath the new plaid cap. <lb/>
							The Texan said something, not loud, harsh and short.
							He entered the lot and went to the husband and jerked the uplifted rope
							from his hand. The husband whirled as though he were about to spring at
							the Texan, crouched slightly, his knees bent and his arms held slightly
							away from his sides, though his gaze never mounted higher than the
							Texan's carved and dusty boots. Then the Texan took the husband by the
							arm and led him back toward the gate, the wife following, and through
							the gate which he held open for the woman and then closed. He took a wad
							of banknotes from his trousers and removed a bill from it and put it
							into the woman's hand. "Get him into the wagon and get him on home," he
							said. <lb/>
							"What's that for?" Flem Snopes said. He had
							approached. He now stood beside the post on which the Texan had been
							sitting. The Texan didn't look at him.<lb/>
							"Thinks he bought one of them
							ponies," the Texan said. He spoke in a flat still voice, like that of a
							man after a sharp run. "Get him on away, missus."<lb/>
							"Give him back that
							money," the husband said, in his lifeless, spent tone. "I bought that
							horse and I aim to have him if I got to shoot him before I can put a
							rope on him." The Texan did not even look at him.<lb/>
							"Get him on away from
							here, missus," he said.<lb/>
							"You take your money and I take my horse," the
							husband said. He was shaking slowly and steadily now, as though he were
							cold. His hands open and shut below the frayed cuffs of his shirt. "Give
							it back to him," he said.<lb/> "You dont—you dont own no horse of mine," the Texan
							said. "Get him on home, missus." The husband raised his spent face, his
							mad glazed eyes. He reached out his hand. The woman held the banknote in
							her folded hands across her stomach. For a while the husband's shaking
							hand merely fumbled at it. Then he drew the banknote free.<lb/> "It's my
							horse," he said. "I bought it. These fellows saw me. I paid for it. It's
							my horse. Here." He turned and extended the banknote toward Snopes. "You
							got something to do with these horses. I bought one. Here's the money
							for it. I bought one. Ask him." Snopes took the banknote.</writing><lb/>
						<event desc="turning pages"/>They're in the lot again still trying to catch the horses. This is Eck and
						the little boy.<lb/>
						<writing>"Watch out, paw!" the boy said. "There he is! There's
							ourn!" It was the one the Texan had given Eck. "Catch him, Paw!"<lb/> 
							"Get
							out of my way," Eck said. "Get back to that wagon." The line was still
							advancing. The ponies milled, clotting, forced gradually backward toward the
							open door of the barn. Henry was still slightly in front, crouched slightly,
							his thin figure, even in the mazy moonlight, emanating something of that
							spent fury. The splotchy huddle of animals seemed to be moving before the
							advancing line of men like a snowball which they might have been pushing
							before them by some invisible means, gradually nearer and nearer to the
							back—black yawn of the barn door. Later it was obvious that the ponies were so
							intent upon the men that they did not realize that the barn was even behind
							them until they backed into the shadow of it. Then an indescribable sound, a
							movement of desperate and despairing, arose among them; for an instant of
							static horror men and animals faced one another, then the men whirled and
							ran before a gaudy vomit of long wild faces and splotched chests which
							overtook and scattered them and flung them sprawling aside and completely
							obliterated from sight Henry and the little boy, neither of whom had moved
							though Henry had flung up both arms, still holding his coiled rope, the herd
							sweeping on across the lot, to crash through the gate which the last man
							through it had neglected to close, leaving it slightly ajar, carrying all of
							the gate save the upright to which the hinges were nailed with them, and so
							among the teams and wagons which choked the lane, the teams springing and
							lunging too, snapping hitch-reins and tongues. Then the whole inextricable
							mass crashed among the wagons and eddied and divided about the one in which
							the woman sat, and rushed on down the lane and into the road, dividing, one
							half going one way and one half the other.<lb/>
							The men in the lot, except Henry, got to their feet
							and ran toward the gate. The little boy once more had not been touched,
							not even thrown off his feet; for a while his father held him clear of
							the ground in one hand, shaking him like a rag doll. "Didn't I tell you
							to stay in that wagon?" Eck cried. "Didn't I tell you?"<lb/>
							"Look out, paw!"
							the boy chattered out of the violent shaking. "There's ourn! There he
							goes!" It was the horse the Texan had given them again. It was as if
							they owned no other, the other one did not exist; as if by some absolute
							and instantaneous rapport of blood they had relegated to oblivion the
							one for which they had paid money. They ran to the gate and down the
							lane where the other men had disappeared. They saw the horse the Texan
							had given them whirl and dash back and rush through the gate into Mrs
							Littlejohn's yard and run up the front steps and crash once on the
							wooden veranda and vanish through the front door. Eck and the boy ran up
							onto the veranda. A lamp sat on a table just inside the door. In its
							mellow light they saw the horse fill the long hallway like a pinwheel,
							gaudy, furious and thunderous. A little further down the hall there was
							a varnished yellow melodeon. The horse crashed into it; it produced a
							single note, almost a chord, in bass, resonant and grave, of deep and
							sober astonishment; <event desc="audience laughter"/> the horse with its
							monstrous and antic shadow whirled again and vanished through another
							door. It was a bedroom; Ratliff, in his underclothes and one sock and
							with the other sock in his hand and his back to the door, was leaning
							out the open window facing the lane, the lot. He looked back over his
							shoulder. For an instant he and the horse glared at one another. Then he
							sprang through the window as the horse backed out of the room and into
							the hall again and whirled and saw Eck and the little boy just entering
							the front door, Eck still carrying his rope. It whirled again and rushed
							on down the hall and onto the back porch just as Mrs Littlejohn,
							carrying an armful of clothes from the line and the washboard, mounted
							the steps.<lb/>
							"Get out of here, you son of a bitch," she said. <event
								desc="audience laughter"/> She struck with the washboard; it divided
							neatly on the long mad face and the horse whirled and rushed back up the
							hall, where Eck and the boy now stood. <lb/>
							"Get to hell out of here, Wall!" Eck roared. <event
								desc="audience laughter"/> He dropped to the floor, covering his
							head with his arms. The boy didn't move, and for the third time the
							horse soared above the unwinking eyes and the unbowed and untouched head
							and onto the front veranda again just as Ratliff, still carrying the
							sock, came around the corner of the house and up the steps. <event
								desc="audience laughter"/> The horse whirled without breaking or
							pausing. He galloped to the end of the veranda and took the railing and
							soared outward, hobgoblin and floating, in the moon. It landed in the
							lot still running and crossed the lot and galloped through the wrecked
							gate and among the overturned wagons and the still intact one in which
							Henry's wife still sat, and on down the lane and into the road.<lb/>
							A quarter of a mile further on, the road gashed
							pallid and moony between the moony shadows of the bordering trees, the
							horse still galloping, galloping its shadow into the dust, the road
							descending now toward the creek and the bridge. It was of wood, just
							wide enough for a single vehicle. When the horse reached it, it was
							occupied by a wagon coming from the opposite direction and drawn by two
							mules already asleep in the harness and the soporific motion. On the
							seat was Tull and his wife, in splint chairs in the wagon behind them
							sat their four daughters, all returning belated from an all-day visit
							with some of Mrs Tull's kin. The horse neither checked nor swerved. It
							crashed once on the wooden bridge and rushed between the two mules
								<event desc="audience laughter"/> which waked lunging in opposite
							directions in the traces, the horse now apparently scrambling along the
							wagon-tongue itself like a mad squirrel and scrambling at the end-gate
							of the wagon with its forefeet as if it intended to climb into the wagon
							while Tull shouted at it and struck at its face with his whip. The mules
							were now trying to turn the wagon around in the middle of the bridge. It
							slewed and tilted, the bridge-rail cracked with a sharp report above the
							shrieks of the women; the horse scrambled at last across the back of one
							of the mules and Tull stood up in the wagon and kicked at its face.
								<event desc="audience laughter"/> Then the front end of the wagon
							rose, flinging Tull, the reins now wrapped several times about his
							wrist, backward into the wagon bed among the overturned chairs and
							the exposed stockings and undergarments of his women. The pony scrambled
							free and crashed again on the wooden planking, galloping again. The
							wagon lurched again; the mules had finally turned it on the bridge where
							there was not room for it to turn and were now kicking themselves free
							of the traces. When they came free, they snatched Tull bodily out of the
							wagon. He struck the bridge on his face and was dragged for several feet
							before the wrist-wrapped reins broke. Far up the road now, distancing
							the frantic mules, the pony faded on. While the five women still
							shrieked above Tull's unconscious body, Eck and the little boy came up,
							trotting, Eck still carrying his rope. He was panting. "Which way'd he
							go?" he said. <event desc="audience laughter"/><lb/>
							In the now empty and moon-drenched lot, his wife and
							Mrs Littlejohn and Ratliff and Lump Snopes, the clerk, and three other
							men raised Henry out of the trampled dust and carried him into Mrs
							Littlejohn's back yard. His face was blanched and stony, his eyes were
							closed, the weight of his head tautened his throat across the protruding
							larynx; his teeth glinted dully beneath his lifted lip. They carried him
							on toward the house, through the dappled shade of the chinaberry trees.
							Across the dreaming and silver night a faint sound like remote thunder
							came and ceased. "There's one of them on the creek bridge," one of the
							men said.<lb/>
							"It's that one of Eck's," another said. "The one that
							was in the house." Mrs Littlejohn had preceded them into the hall. When
							they entered with Henry, she had already taken the lamp from the table
							and she now stood beside an open door, holding the lamp high.<lb/>
							"Bring him in
							here," she said. She entered the room first and set the lamp on the
							dresser. They followed with clumsy scufflings and pantings and laid
							Henry on the bed and Mrs Littlejohn came to the bed and stood looking
							down at Henry's peaceful and bloodless face. "I'll declare," she said.
							"You men." <event desc="audience laughter"/></writing> <event desc="end of recording"/>
