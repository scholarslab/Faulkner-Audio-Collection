						"Hah," Mr Hubert said again. "This is the most
						serious foolishness you ever took part in in your life. No, you said you
						wanted your chance, and now you've got it. Here it is, right here on the 
						table, waiting on you."

					So Uncle Buck shuffled the cards and Mr Hubert cut them.
						Then he took up the deck and dealt in turn until Uncle Buck and Mr Hubert
						had five. And Uncle Buck looked at his hand a long time and then said two
						cards and he gave them to him, and Mr Hubert looked at his hand quick and
						said one card and he gave it to him and Mr Hubert flipped his discard onto
						the two which Uncle Buck had discarded and slid the new card into his hand
						and opened it out and looked at it quick again and closed it and looked at
						Uncle Buck and said, "Well? Did you help them threes?"
						"No," Uncle Buck said.
						"Well I did," Mr Hubert said. He shot his hand across the table so the
						cards fell face-up in front of Uncle Buck and they were three kings and two
						fives, and said, "By God, Buck McCaslin, you have met your match at
							last."

					"And that was all?" Uncle Buddy said. It was late then,
						near sunset; they would be at Mr Hubert's in another fifteen minutes.
						"Yes,
						sir," he said, telling that too: how Uncle Buck waked him at daylight and he
						climbed out a window and got the pony and left, and how Uncle Buck said that
						if they pushed him too close in the meantime, he would climb down the gutter
						too and hide in the woods until Uncle Buddy arrived.
						"Hah," Uncle&mdash;Uncle Buddy
						said. "Was Tomey's Turl there?"

					And that was about all. They reached the house. Maybe
						Uncle Buck was watching them, but if he was, he never showed himself, never
						came out of the woods. So Miss Sophonsiba was nowhere in sight either, so at
						least Uncle Buck didn't give&mdash;hadn't quite given up; at least he hadn't asked her yet.
						And he and Uncle Buddy and Mr Hubert ate supper and they came in from the
						kitchen and cleared the table, leaving only the lamp on it and the deck of
						cards. Then it was just like last night, except that Uncle Buddy had no
						necktie and Mr Hubert wore the clothes now instead of a nightshirt and it
						was a shaded lamp on the table instead of a candle, and Mr Hubert sitting at
						his end of the table with the deck in his hands, riffling the edges with his
						thumb and looking at Uncle Buddy. Then he tapped the edges even and set the
						deck out in the middle of the table under the lamp, and folded his arms on
						the edge of the table and leaned forward a little on the table, looking at
						Uncle Buddy, who was sitting at his end of the table with his hands in his
						lap, all one gray color, like an old gray rock or a stump with gray moss on
						it, that still, with his round white head like Uncle Buck's but he didn't
						blink like Uncle Buck and he was a little thicker than Uncle Buck, as if
						from sitting down so much watching food cook, as if the things he cooked had
						made him a little thicker than he would have been and the things he cooked
						with, and the flour and such, had made him all one same quiet color.

							"Little toddy before we start?" Mr Hubert said. "I dont
								drink," Uncle Buddy said.
								"That's right," Mr Hubert said. "I knew there was
						some thing else besides just being woman-weak that makes 'Filus seem human.
						But no matter." He batted his eyes twice at Uncle Buddy. "Buck McCaslin
						against the land and niggers you have heard me promise as Sophonsiba's dowry
						on the day she marries. If I beat you, 'Filus marries Sibbey without any
						dowry. If you beat me, you get 'Filus. But I still get the three hundred
								dollars 'Filus owes me for Tennie. Is that correct?"
								"That's correct," Uncle
								Buddy said.
								"Stud," Mr Hubert said. "One hand. You to shuffle, me to cut,
								this boy to deal."
								"No," Uncle Buddy said. "Not Cass. He's too young. I dont
								want him mixed up in any gambling."
								"Hah," Mr Hubert said. "It's said that a
						man playing cards with Amodeus McCaslin aint gambling. But no matter." 
						He was still looking at Uncle Buddy; he never even turned his head when he
						spoke: "Go to the back door and holler. Bring the first creature that
						answers, animal mule or human, that can deal ten cards."

					So he went to the back door. But he didn't even need to call
						because Tomey's Turl was squatting against the wall just outside the door,
						and they returned to the drawing-room where Mr Hubert still sat with his
						arms folded on his side of the table and Uncle Buddy sat with his hands in
						his lap on his side and the deck of cards face-down under the lamp between
						them. Neither of them even looked up when he and Tomey's Turl entered.
						"Shuffle," Mr Hubert said. Uncle Buddy shuffled and set the cards back under
						the lamp and put his hands back in his lap and Mr Hubert cut the deck and
						folded his arms back onto the table-edge. "Deal," he said. Still neither he
						nor Uncle Buddy looked up. They just sat there while&mdash;while Tomey's Turl's
						saddle-colored hands came into the light and took up the deck and dealt, one
						card face-down to Mr Hubert and one face-down to Uncle Buddy, and one
						face-up to Mr Hubert and it was a king, and one face-up to Uncle Buddy and
						it was a six.

					"Deal," Mr Hubert said, and the hand dealt him an ace

						Buddy put one hand onto the table for the first time since he shuffled and
						pinch up one corner of his face-down card and look at it and and then put
						his hand back into his lap. "Check," Mr Hubert said.
						"I'll bet you them two

						"Against what?" Mr Hubert said.
						"Against the three hundred dollars
						Theophilus owes you for Tennie, and the three hundred you and Theophilus
						agreed on for Tomey's Turl," Uncle Buddy said.
						"Hah," Mr Hubert said, only

						Hah" and not loud either. Then he said, "Well." Then he said, "Well, well."
						Then he said: "We'll check up for a minute. If I win, you take Sibbey
						without a dowry and the two niggers, and I dont owe 'Filus anything. If you
						win&mdash;"
						"&mdash;Theophilus is free," Uncle Buddy said.  "And you owe him the three hundred dollars for

						it was like he and Uncle Buddy had both gone to sleep. Then Mr Hubert picked
						up his face-down card and turned it over. It was another three, and Mr
						Hubert sat there without looking at anything at all, his fingers beating a
						tattoo, slow and steady and not very loud, on the table. "H'm," he said.
						"And you need a trey and there aint but four of them and I already got
						three. And you just shuffled. And I cut afterward. And if I call you, I will
						have to buy that nigger. Who dealt these cards, Amodeus?" Only he didn't
						wait to be answered. He reached out and tilted the lamp-shade, the light
						moving up Tomey's Turl's arms that were supposed to be black but were not
						quite white, up his Sunday shirt that was supposed to be white but wasn't
						quite either, that he put on every time he ran away just as Uncle Buck put
						on the necktie each time he went to bring him back, and on to his face; and
						Mr Hubert sat there, holding the lampshade and looking at Tomey's Turl. Then
						he tilted the shade back down and took up his cards and turned them
						face-down and pushed them across the middle of the table. "I pass, Amodeus,"

					He was still too worn out for sleep to sit on a horse,
						so this time he and Uncle Buddy and Tennie all three rode in the wagon,
						while Tomey's Turl led the pony from old Jake. And when they got home just
						after daylight, this time Uncle Buddy never even had time to get breakfast
						started and the fox never even got out of the crate, because the dogs were
						right there in the room. Old Moses went right into the crate with the fox,
						so that both of them went right&mdash;right on out through the back end of it. That is,
						the fox went through, because when Uncle Buddy opened the door to come in,
						old Moses was still wearing most of the crate around his neck until Uncle
						Buddy kicked it off him. So they made just one run, across the front
						gallery and around the house and they could hear the fox's claws when&mdash;when he
						went scrabbling up the lean-pole, onto the roof&mdash;a fine race while it lasted,
						but&mdash;but the tree was too quick.
					"What in damn's hell do you mean," Uncle Buddy said,

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Mr. Faulkner, this is a little bit off the theme of literature, but I'd
					like to&mdash;if you wouldn't mind tell us a little about your trip to Greece? <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[I think]</span> I would
					like to hear a little about that, if that's not getting too far off the subject,
					too far away from it.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>It was a&mdash;a strange experience in that that was the only country that
					looked exactly like&mdash;we had&mdash;I mean, the&mdash;the background, the&mdash;the educational
					background of&mdash;of the Anglo-Saxon had taught him to expect it to look. And sure
					enough, there was the Hellenic light that I had heard of, had read about. And I
					saw Homer's wine-dark sea, too. And there was a&mdash;the only place I was in where
					there was a sense of a very distant past, but there was nothing inimical in it.
					In the other parts of&mdash;of the Old World there's a sense of&mdash;of the past, but
					there is something&mdash;something <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Gothic]</span>&mdash;Gothic and in a sense 
					a little terrifying. In Greece, the people seem to function against that past
					that for all its&mdash;its remoteness in time, it was&mdash;was still inherent in
					the&mdash;the&mdash;the light, the resurgence of spring. You didn't expect to see the&mdash;the
					ghost of&mdash;of the old Greeks, or expect to see the actual figures of the gods, but
					you had a sense that they&mdash;they were near, and they were still powerful, not
					inimical, just&mdash;just powerful. That they themselves had&mdash;had reached and were
					enjoying a&mdash;a kind of a nirvana. They existed, but they were free of&mdash;of man's
					folly and trouble, of having to involve themselves in man's problem. That they
					were&mdash;at last had the time to watch what man did without having to be involved in
					it. Yes, it was&mdash;was very interesting. I&mdash;I think that&mdash;that two weeks is not only
					too short, it's an insult to that country, that one should go with&mdash;with no limit
					to his visit. That there's no end to what you can see, and then sure enough, you
					see something which is exactly like what you imagined. There will be the plain
					and&mdash;and across it, suddenly there is Parnassus with snow on it, and the old
					ruins&mdash;they look ancient, but there's a sense as though it happened only
					yesterday. That whether Agamemnon ever lived, ever was an actual man or not,
					there he was, he&mdash;because he had to be. It was necessary. That he&mdash;he was in the
					literary history of man's spirit, so therefore he must have existed at one time
					as a flesh and blood man.

					Flem Snopes assuming the mask of respectability. And I was wondering, since you,
					I think, are going to write a trilogy, that&mdash;I was wondering what type of
					character would Flem Snopes assume, say, in your next book?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>He had never heard of respectability. He didn't even know it existed,
					until suddenly <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> he found that he needed it. And
					so he assumed it, and as soon as he doesn't need respectability any longer, he
					will cast it away. That he had a certain aim which he intended to attain. He
					would use whatever tools necessary, with complete ruthlessness, to gain that
					end. And if he had to use respectability, he would use that. If he had to use
					religious observance, he would use that. If he has to destroy his wife, he will
					do that. If he has to&mdash;to trick a&mdash;a&mdash;a child, a girl child, into&mdash;to being his
					tool, he will do that with no compunction whatever. That respectability to him
					was just a tool.</p>

					what extent are they just people who keep developing as characters and let

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, the character comes first as people. I&mdash;I didn't have enough formal
					education to&mdash;to know really what ideas are, that ideas to me must be translated
					into&mdash;to the human being struggling against his own problems. The ideas are only
					incidental or maybe coincidental to writing about people, and the&mdash;the ideas of
					the&mdash;the symbolism, they are simply, in my own case, the tools which the
					craftsman uses to tell the story, but his interest is primarily in the
					characters, not in the plot, not really so much in what they do, but it's in&mdash;in
					making the&mdash;the&mdash;the figure of his imagination assume three dimensions and stand
					on its own feet and cast its own shadow. The symbolism, the style, the ideas are
					only coincidental to that and are simply the tools which the craftsman

<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>But would&mdash;would you say then, sir,

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>The germ of the story was one of the three oldest ideas that&mdash;that man

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Mr. Faulkner, to what extent have you drawn directly on experience for
					these stories?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>That's difficult to say. The writer, I think, has three reservoirs: one
					is experience, which includes what he has read. The other is observation, which,
					of course, is what he has seen and done. The third is imagination.  And he
					himself doesn't know, and, in fact, he hasn't gotten time to be concerned or to
					care how much of which he draws on at any one time. It's as though he had three
					reservoirs with three pipes that go to a common tap, with maybe a&mdash;an automatic
					selector somewhere that&mdash;that when&mdash;when observation doesn't go far enough, it
					tries experience. When experience hasn't gone far enough, it reverts to
					imagination, that the only check is some rigid concept of what is truth and what
					is not truth in&mdash;in the craftsman, which what he does has got to match. If it
					doesn't match, he throws it away, and then he's got to&mdash;to go back to
					imagination. If that is not enough, then he's got to&mdash;to increase his experience
					or his observation. But no man can say just how much of&mdash;of each he uses. He
					knows, any writer, that he is going to change and alter anything he writes
					because any fiction writer is a congenital liar to begin with, you see. He is
					not going to&mdash;to take anything as is. He's going to change it.

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Sir, is there any one incident in your life that you just decided then
					that you were going to become a writer?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>I was living in New Orleans. I was running a&mdash;a power boat for a
					bootlegger. I would go down <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> and take the boat
					with a&mdash;a&mdash;a man with a gun and a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;Negro hand for the crew through the industrial
					canal across the&mdash;the Mississippi Sound to an island where the schooner would
					bring the raw alcohol up from the Indies, and we would load the cargo and bring
					it back to town. I'd get a hundred dollars for each trip, and in those days,
					that was a lot of money, so I wouldn't have to work until I began to run out of
					money. Then I would make another run with the boat, and I met Sherwood Anderson,
					and I liked him at once. We would meet and walk around the French Quarter, and
					he would talk, and I would listen. We would meet again in the evening. We'd go
					to some pleasant courtyard, and we'd sit over a bottle of whiskey, and he would
					talk, and I would listen. In the mornings, he would be in seclusion working.
					That went on day after day, and I thought if&mdash;if that's all you had to do to be a
					writer, then that was the life for me, <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> so I
						<span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[decided I wanted to]</span> become a writer, and I started a
					book, and right away I found it was fun to do, and I hadn't seen Mr. Anderson in
					weeks. I met Mrs. Anderson on the street, and she said, "We haven't seen you." I
					said, "Yes'm, I'm writing a book." She said, "Good God." <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> I saw her again a few weeks later. She said, "I
					told Anderson&mdash;Sherwood you were writing a book. She says, "Do I want him,
						Mr. Anderson, to read it?'" I said, "Well'm, he can if he
					wants to." She said, "Well, he told me to tell you he'll make a trade with you.
					If he don't have to read that manuscript, he'll tell his publisher to take it."
					So I said, "done." <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> And I finished the
					manuscript, and he told his publisher to take it, and that's how I got to be a
					professional writer. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> But, of course, by that
					time, I'd found that writing was fun. It was&mdash;was&mdash;was the most fun I'd found yet,
					and I knew then that I had been bitten and was incurable.

					so many hours a day whether they write anything or not. They do research. They

<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>I have a question I've always wanted to ask an author, is do they really

					your state, or just because you think you've got to write a good story and make
					some money off of it?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>No, no. All that is incidental. What the writer is&mdash;is&mdash;is doing is trying
					to create people. He hasn't got time to bother with the symbols and the message.
					The first-rate writer hasn't. He is busy creating people, and he would do that

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>That was an unfortunate remark I made about twenty years ago that I've

					group meeting something like this. Someone asked me how I rated my
					contemporaries. I said it's too soon to rate us, we haven't finished yet. He
					said, "Well, you have&mdash;haven't you any opinion at all about them?" I said, "About
					who?" He named Wolfe, Dos Passos, Caldwell, and Hemingway. I said, "Well," and
					this was sort of off the cuff. I never thought of it before. I said, "Well, I&mdash;I
					think we all failed, and so I would rate them on the&mdash;the splendor of the
					failure." I put Wolfe first because he made the&mdash;the&mdash;the most splendid failure. I
					put myself second. I put Dos Passos third, Caldwell fourth and Hemingway fifth.
					It had nothing to do with the value of the work we'd done but on the&mdash;on the
					splendor with which we had failed. I put Hemingway last because he had found
					quickly a&mdash;a method in which he was secure, and he didn't need to splash around,
					to experiment, that he stuck to that, and he didn't&mdash;didn't need to&mdash;to try to&mdash;to
					put all the history of man's heart onto one pinhead and one paragraph, which
					Wolfe had tried to do, which is why Wolfe's material would have been unreadable
					had it not been for his editor, Mr. Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, and Mr.
					Perkins in&mdash;in a way really wrote Wolfe's book because the mass of incoherent

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>No, I don't. That would take a&mdash;a different mentality from mine to accept

					except these&mdash;these exceptions we spoke of, who are inhuman and who are&mdash;are&mdash;are
					devils, but in general, man is capable of&mdash;of absurdity, just as he's capable of
					grandeur, but he is not consistently capable of any. My belief is that he wants
					to be consistently capable always of&mdash;of the best things of&mdash;of&mdash;of grandeur, of
					courage, of compassion, of honesty, but he fails.  But&mdash;but to me he's not absurd.
