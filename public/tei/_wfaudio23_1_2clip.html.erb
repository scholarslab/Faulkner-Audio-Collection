  <p><strong>Joseph Blotner:</strong>Sir, this sounds an awful lot like
                            a novel called <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>
                            <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[with]</span> Quentin Compson wanting to love people and the same sort
                            of relationship with his sister.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I don't quite agree with you. I don't believe that&#x2014;that
                            Quentin and Holden were very much alike except in being a little too sensitive
                            and coming from a somewhat similar background of&#x2014;of people that
                            were&#x2014;were over-intelligent but incapable of&#x2014;of any strength
                            of&#x2014;of mutual affection and tenderness, which, as I got it,
                            was&#x2014;was Holden's home.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>A. K. Davis:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, Holden wasn't grown up, and Quentin was grown up. He was
                            holding onto something.  He was a case of arrested
                            development, and Holden was a case of . Isn't that true?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir, there was that difference.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>A. K. Davis:</strong>I don't know whether I read Quentin right or not, but he was holding onto
                            an ideal, wasn't he, sir?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>A. K. Davis:</strong>That&#x2014;that simply could not be lived up to in his terms.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, that's right. That couldn't have been lived up to in any time
                            maybe. But Holden Caulfield was simply looking for something which should be
                            everybody's right, not only a privilege, but everybody's right, to find mankind
                            and&#x2014;and love mankind and be accepted into mankind, and he couldn't,
                            because mankind, as I tried to say in my paper, in Holden's terms, wasn't there anymore.</p>
