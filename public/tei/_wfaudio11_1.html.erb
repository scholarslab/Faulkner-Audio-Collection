						Sutpen, he call&mdash;you spell it K-E-R-N-E-L, when the Negroes are talking you

<p><strong>Edward Stephenson: </strong>That's the idea.</p>

<p><strong>Edward Stephenson: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>The Negro don't have the hard "r."</p>
<p><strong>Edward Stephenson: </strong>I assumed that that was the purpose of that. Now if Colonel Sutpen

						characters. Wouldn't they all say "dawg"? Don't you say "dawg"? Doesn't
						everybody in Mississippi say "dawg."</p>
<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>Yes, the reason for that is that someone has said southerners don't
						read books; they write books. And I think that when the southerner writes
						deliberately spelled dialect, he is writing not for the man that calls "dog"
						"dawg," but for the man that calls "dog" "dog."</p>
<p><strong>Edward Stephenson: </strong>But "dawg"&mdash;"dawg" is very general all over the country. Of course in
						some parts of the Midwest people do say "dog." But in New England and the
						South, and a large part of the rest of the country D-O-G is "dawg"</p>
<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>Yes, but these people would speak with a&mdash;even more flatness than

						"hit" which I'm familiar with in Georgia. It's an old form that's survived.
						But it seems to me, at least in Georgia, the distinction is this. In an
						unstressed, where the&mdash;where the syllable would not be accented&mdash;for instance,
						you could hardly say&mdash;if you wanted to say "Move it over thar," you&mdash;it would
						be hard say "move hit over thar." But if you said, "Hit don't make no
						difference"&mdash;or&mdash;when it's stressed, it would be "hit." But I notice you use it
						rather indiscriminately whether it would be in a stress position or not in a
						stress position. I think&mdash;I think you were careless in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>Perhaps so, but I think I have heard it used&mdash;sometimes the same man
						will say "move hit yonder" or "move it yonder."</p>
<p><strong>Atcheson Hench: </strong>And "make it now" and "make hit now."</p>
<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>That's right, the same&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Atcheson Hench: </strong>More deliberation.</p>
<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>Well, I don't know. It's&mdash;he probably is not aware himself. At

<p><strong>Joseph Blotner: </strong>I should think his&mdash;the speed with which he spoke or the emotion&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>William Faulkner: </strong>Yes, has a lot to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Blotner: </strong>That might even determine which spelling&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Edward Stephenson: </strong>For instance, here's one. Wash says, "You make hit right," and you
