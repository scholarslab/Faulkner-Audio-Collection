<p><div class="speaker">Moderator</div>Good evening, ladies and
					gentlemen. On behalf of the Jefferson Society, Omicron Delta Kappa, and the
						Raven Society, I welcome you tonight to what we consider a&mdash;a rare honor and a
					privilege. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to a gentleman
					who I don't believe could be any&mdash;could have been any more aptly chosen, a
					gentleman who is a member of the Jefferson Society and at one time served as her
					president, who is a member of Omicron Delta Kappa&mdash;Kappa, a member in
					longstanding of the Raven Society and a holder of the Raven Award, Dean of the
					Law School, Dean Ribble. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span></p>

<p><div class="speaker">Dean F. D. G. Ribble</div>Ladies and gentlemen, I shall not
					introduce our distinguished speaker who happily has been a member of our
					community for a year and half. I would like to just say a word of thanks to the
					three ancient and honorable organizations which have planned this meeting for
					us. They're all very old. As we say in law, so old that memory&mdash;the memory of man
					runneth not to the contrary. The oldest, I believe, is the Jefferson Society. It
					started in 1825 and had as one of its first members Edgar Allan Poe, so you see
					their interest in men of letters is quite old. The other two have equally and
					greatly added to the life of this University, and the three of them are adding
					to their fame and to our debt of gratitude to them by presenting to us tonight a
					gentlemen who is a great American, a great southerner, and one whom we're very
						proud to have as a member of our university, Mr. William Faulkner. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span></p>

					that likes and admires Virginia and Virginia people. I hope that&mdash;that now you
					will take me under those conditions, that I'm just a private citizen here that
					likes and admires Virginia, Virginia people, even when they may not like what

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Mr. Chairman, members of the Jefferson Society, the Raven
						Society, ODK, and ladies and gentlemen, a hundred years ago Abraham Lincoln
						said, "This nation cannot endure half slave and half free." If he were alive
						today, he would amend it: "This nation cannot endure containing a minority
						as large as ten percent held second class in citizenship by the accident of
						physical appearance." As a lesser man might put it, this nor any country or
						community of people can no more get along in peace with ten percent of its
						population arbitrarily unassimilated than a town of five thousand people can
						get along in peace with five hundred unbridled horses loose in the streets,
						or, say, a community of five thousand cats with five hundred unassimilated
						dogs among them, or vice versa. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> For
						peaceful coexistence, all must be one thing&mdash;either all first-class citizens
						or all second-class citizens, either all people or all horses, either all

					Perhaps the Negro is not yet capable of more than
						second-class citizenship. His tragedy may be that so far he is competent for
						equality only in the ratio of his white blood. But even if that is so, the
						problem of the second-class citizens still remains. It would not solve the
						problem even if the Negro were himself content to remain only a second-class
						citizen, even though relieved of his first-class responsibilities by his
						classification. The fact would still remain that we are a nation established
						on the fact that we are only ninety percent unified in power. With only
						ninety percent of unanimity, we would face, and hope to survive in it, an
						inimical world unified against us, even if only in inimicality. We cannot be
						even ninety percent unified against that inimical world, which outnumbers
						us, because too much of even that ninety percent of power is spent and
						consumed by the physical problem of the ten percent of
							irresponsibles.

					It is easy enough for the North to blame on us, the

						us, North and South&mdash;had put this to the test and had solved it. That it is

					Instead, we should accept that gambit. Let us say to the
						North, "All right, it is our problem, and we will solve it." For the sake of
						the argument, let us agree that as yet the Negro is incapable of equality
						for the reason that he could not hold and keep it, even if were forced on
						him with bayonets, that once the bayonets were removed, the first smart and
						ruthless man, black or white, who came along would take it away from him,

					So we, the white man, must take him in hand and teach

						in the long record of man's history that moral principle has been identical
						with and even inextricable from practical common sense. Let us teach him
						that, in order to be free and equal, he must first be worthy of it, and then
						forever afterward work to hold and keep and defend it. He must learn to
						cease forever more thinking like a Negro and acting like a Negro. This will
						not be easy for him. His burden will be that, because of his race and color,
						it will not suffice for him to think and act like just any white man. He
						must think and act like the best among white men. Because where the white
						man, because of his race and color, can practice morality and rectitude just
						on Sunday and let the rest of the week go hang, the Negro can never let up

					That is our job here in the South. It is possible that
						the white race and the Negro race can never really like and trust each
						other&mdash;this for the reason that the white man can never really know the
						Negro, because the white man has forced the Negro to be always a Negro
						rather than another human being in their dealings. And therefore the Negro
						cannot afford, does not dare, to be open with the white man and let the
						white man know what he, the Negro, thinks. But I do know that we in the
						South, having grown up and lived among Negroes for generations, are capable
						in individual cases, of liking and trusting individual Negroes, which the
						North can never do because the northerner only fears him.

						unpleasant habits. Whether or not he ever learns his ABCs or what to do with
						common fractions won't matter. What he must learn are the hard
						things&mdash;self-restraint, honesty, dependability, purity, to act not even as
						well as just any white man, but to act as well as the best of white men. If
						we don't, we will spend the rest of our lives dodging among the five hundred
						unbridled horses. We will look forward each year to another Clinton or

						Yet even in our wilderness we look back to that mother stock as though it
						were not really so distant and so far removed. Even in our wilderness the
						old Virginia blood still runs, and the old Virginia names&mdash;Byrd and Lee and
						Carter&mdash;still endure. There is no family in our wilderness but has that old
						aunt or grandmother to tell the children as soon as they can hear and
						understand, "Your blood is Virginia blood, too. Your
						great-great-great-grandfather was born in Rockbridge or Fairfax or Prince
						George, Valley or Piedmont or Tidewater," right down to the nearest

					Yes, I agree with you. But then, the Negro is not going to wait right now while

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Sir, in your talk you had an analogy comparing the Negro with&mdash;with

					lot of tame ones in, don't you think it's a possibility that you may wind up
					with just a big group of half-wild horses? <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Well, of course, I used the&mdash;the horse as a&mdash;as a quick analogy to&mdash;to
					state a condition. What I meant by that was, the horse that&mdash;that can be trained
					and maybe has been trained&mdash;we'll assume that&mdash;that while that horse was a slave,
					then&mdash;then he was a&mdash;a docile, well-behaved horse. But then he was&mdash;the burden of
					slavery was lifted from him, and he was suddenly freed. That he is still capable
					of being a docile member of society, but the condition in which he was compelled
					to be a docile member is gone, and so we will have to establish a new condition
					in which he is&mdash;is docile not through pressure, but because he himself wants to

					unbridled horses. And I think that if&mdash;if the people in Mississippi and Arkansas
					and Alabama could find that there were people in Virginia that would take the
					lead in this, they would follow for the reason that there is a respect, a&mdash;a
					feeling of veneration toward Virginia that exists, as I tried to explain,
					everywhere in the rest of the South. Whether it's&mdash;it's valid or not, I don't
					know, and from some of the things that I have seen Virginia do since I've been
					here, I may agree that it's not too valid, but I think that basically there is
					that feeling, and I believe that there is in Virginia the capacity to take the
					first step in solving&mdash;solving this problem, and if it is taken in Virginia, the
					people in Mississippi and Alabama will follow when they wouldn't follow Alabama
					nor Mississippi.</p>

<p><div class="speaker">Dean F. D. G. Ribble</div>There's someone over here.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Mr. Faulkner, on the subject of race relations, it seems to me that the
					continuum in the United States is one of polarity, that is, the only view
					tolerated is an&mdash;is the extreme view. If you agree with that premise of mine,
					would you say that there will be resurgence&mdash;a resurgence of a moderate view on
					this subject, and what is your conception of that view?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>I would say that the Negro doesn't want to mix with white people any
					more than white people want to mix with the Negro. The Negro simply wants the
					right himself to decide not to mix. I think that&mdash;that he doesn't want to&mdash;to go
					to white schools just because they're white schools. I think he wants to go to
					them because he's under the delusion that white schools are good schools. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> 
					I think from&mdash;from what I've seen of a lot of schools
					that no really industrious Negro would want to go to one. Now that's not true of
					all schools, but&mdash;but it's true of too many white schools. I think that what he
					wants is mainly the chance himself to decide to be segregated, and that if he
					had that, with schools so good that the people in the schools would be too busy
					passing the work to care what color who's sitting next to them was, there
					wouldn't be any trouble about integration in schools.

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Sir, would you consider one of the problems&mdash;<span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[disregarding that
						you mentioned that the Negro was fighting for the chance to be able to
						segregate himself]</span>&mdash;is it not true that that is what the white
					southerner is fighting to maintain? In other words, if the Negro is fighting for
					the right of association, aren't the southerners fighting for the equivalent
					right to disassociate? In other words, they don't feel like sacrificing their
					rights completely in order for the Negro to achieve the same rights. In other
					words, they don't feel that they are balanced. Do you think that is a valid
					cause for the southern white to be fighting so strenuously to preserve his
					equivalent right of disassociation?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>I would say it's valid assuming that the southerner's fear is valid. I
					think that his&mdash;his violent attitude toward integration is based in fear. It's&mdash;in
					Mississippi, it's mainly an economic fear, that he has trained the Negro to&mdash;to
					get along with&mdash;with inferior tools and bad stock and yet to make a living and 
					send his children to school. The white man is afraid that if the Negro has
					better tools and better stock, the Negro will take the white man's economy away
					from him. I think he is afraid that if he gives the Negro a chance to choose to
					be segregated, the Negro may not choose it, that if he was just convinced
					that&mdash;that the Negro would want to keep his own churches and his own schools and
					not mix with white people, then the white man would give him that chance, but I
					doubt if&mdash;if some of the white people in the South can ever be brought to take
					that chance.

<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><div class="speaker">Unidentified participant</div>Mr. Faulkner, I believe you inferred in the earlier part of your speech

					this prejudice?</p>
<p><div class="speaker">William Faulkner</div>I myself think that&mdash;that integration as they mean it now will&mdash;will never
					occur, that the Negro doesn't want it either. I would say, though, in&mdash;in five
					hundred years he will have vanished, and I imagine then anyone that wants to
					join the D.A.R. will have to prove that&mdash;that she's got somewhere a strain of
					Negro blood, that they'll be descendants <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> of
					, <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some applause happening">[applause]</span> but as&mdash;I think as the NAACP preaches it, and as
					the White Citizens Councils preach against it, it&mdash;it won't occur because the
					Negro himself, as a race, doesn't want to mix with white people. He don't like
					white people that well. But I do think that all the laws in the world are not
					going to make the two races mix if&mdash;if they don't want to, just as all the laws
					in the world won't keep them apart if they do want to.
