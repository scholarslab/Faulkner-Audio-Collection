                    more and more of liberty, more and more of equality. That Supreme Court decision,
                        in Mississippi anyway, has—has set things back, for the reason you say, that you
                    cannot legislate against—against the mores and against a social
                    condition. You can only state that the social condition is bad and must be

                    <u who="Q"> Well, I'd say that in Mississippi the May 17,1954, decision was
                        not implemented, but it did move Mississippi to try and implement Plessy

                <u who="WF">Well, they had been moving in that direction for some time. They had not
                    moved fast enough. And if there had been no Supreme Court decision, the white
                    people in Mississippi would've been content with the infinitesimal progress they
                    were making. The Supreme Court decision only warned them that—that
                    they must move faster or something must be done, but it still has not changed
                    the—the situation in Mississippi. It has speeded up a gradual
                    evolution, but it hasn't changed overnight any situation there.</u>
                <u who="Q">Well, my point is if it did accelerate even in Mississippi, then
                        it is laws that make effects.</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, yes. It was a—a statement which had effect. That was a
                    decision. That wasn't a law. It was simply a decision on—on the law
                    which the Supreme Court made. It hadn't changed the law in Mississippi.</u></div2>

                <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Going back to your symbolism, you said that the symbol when you're
                    writing would mean one thing to one reader and perhaps another to another
                    reader. When you write, are you ever conscious of writing for a certain group of
                    readers? Do you ever write and then decide, "Well, this won't be
                        <unclear>as</unclear> good, and I'll change it"?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, no. I think the writer writes for himself. In fact, I wrote for
                    years before it occurred to me that strangers might read what I was writing,
                    that the writer writes for himself. He's trying to make something
                    perfect which wasn't here before. When he begins to—to temper what he
                    writes to—to who will read it, then I think the writing itself
                    suffers, but he has got to observe certain rules of—of coherence, but
                    he is writing primarily to depict the world—man struggling in his
                    condition as he himself saw it, that he has seen man in his condition struggle
                    against it in his aspirations, his—his follies, his hopes, his
                    tragedy, which to that writer was so moving that he himself has got to put that
                    down on paper, to—to capture what to him was magic. It may be, though
                    he is not writing for glory, it may be that he knows all the time
                    that—that some day, after his allotted span, he will pass through the
                    last wall of oblivion, and maybe what he's actually doing is simply writing on
                    that wall, "Kilroy was here." <event desc="audience laughter"/></u></div2>

                    wants to use, which in his opinion will build the best chicken coop, is valid.
                    He may decide to use his hammer backward or to saw with—with a
                    kitchen knife, but anything that to him is the best tool he can use to make the
                    chickenhouse as near perfect as he can make it is valid. I think that no one
                    should—should write just to be funny or just to be fantastic.
                    I—I'll take that back. He—he is perfectly at liberty to
                    write just to be funny or just to be fantastic, but I think the one—the 
                    man that's doing that is like the man that writes primarily to be a stylist,
                    that he hasn't got a whole lot to say, that what he has to say is not valid and

                <u who="WF">I think they're restatements. Actually, there're only three subjects to
                    write about: love, money and death. People—writers write about men and
                    women in the—the tragedy of the human condition, and the—the
                    verities which man struggles with are—are eternal. They
                    haven't changed much, and his problems are new only in that they are new and
                    novel to that individual, just like to the young man and young woman, there
                    never was love before like ours, like the one I feel now at 17 and 18 and 19. There
                    never was grief or tragedy like that which I feel now. In—in that
                    sense only is the material new. Actually, it's—it's very old, but
                    it's—the very fact that it can be that old is—is an
                    indication of man's immortality, I think, that he does endure. He
                    has—has lasted so long that there's nothing new in his—his
                    aspiration and hope, save to himself, that there's nothing new in his tragedy,
                    save to himself, that he still can want to be better than he is. He can still
                    believe that injustice shall not endure; it must be changed; it must be
                    corrected. His progress is very slow, almost infinitesimal, but there is
                    progress. Little children, for instance, don't have to work in sweatshops. Your
                    grocer can't sell you poisoned food. Some progress. People are concerned enough
                    to—to try to do away with war, to do away with poverty. That's some
                    advancement. Man should've advanced much faster, I grant you. That's some
                    advancement, and—and if it were not for that capacity to advance, that
                    desire to advance, very likely he would've been effaced from the earth long before
                    this, along with the dinosaur and the other big lizards.

                    the—the piece in the daily newspaper is a—a correlation, a
                    gathering of facts after the fact. That is, no reporter can follow along behind
                    the people who are approaching a crisis or a climax or a crime, say. The writer
                    can do that. He can start when they get up that morning and follow the
                    characters up to the moment when they pull the trigger or rob the bank
                    or—or jump in the water and save the baby, but the reporter has got to
                    go around and—and ask people what happened, what did you see. There's
                    that difference. It's—you might say the same thing but—but

                    is, the reporter can—can ask, inquire, seek out and get the simple
                    facts, and since it's—it's printed in the—in the newspaper,
                    the reader will accept that. In the book, the—the writer is not too
                    sure that his readers will accept that, so he's got to take the fact, if that's
                    where he starts, then he's got to go backward to—to follow these
                    people up to the point, to explain why they—they perform that action.
                    They are quite alike, the two crafts, but they must be approached, as I said,
                    one from—from behind the fact, one from in front of the fact. We might

                <u who="Q">Yes, <inaudible/></u>
                <u who="WF">Well, I'd always liked to scribble, probably, just like the—the
                    would-be lawyer likes to argue maybe and the—the would-be doctor or biologist likes
                    to cut up flies, <event desc="audience laughter"/> but I think I became a
                    professional writer—I was living in New Orleans, and I met Sherwood
                    Anderson, and I liked him at once. We would meet in the afternoon and walk
                    around New Orleans, and he would talk, and I would listen. We would meet again
                    in the evening, and we would go to a pleasant courtyard and sit over a bottle of
                    whiskey, and he would talk, and I would listen until 12 and 1 and 2
                    o'clock. The next morning he'd be in seclusion working. We'd meet again in the
                    afternoon, again in the evening, and the next morning he's in seclusion working,
                    and I thought to myself, if that's all it took to be a writer, then <event desc="audience laughter"/>
                    <inaudible/>. And so I—I started a book, and right away I found that writing
                    was fun. And I hadn't seen Mr. Anderson in—in weeks. I met Ms.
                    Anderson on the street one day. She said, "What the matter? Are you mad at us?"
                    I said, "No, ma'am. I'm writing a book." She said, "Good God." <event desc="audience laughter"/> I 
                    saw her again, and she asked me how the book was
                    getting on. I told her, "Just fine." She said, "Do you want Sherwood to read
                    it?" I hadn't thought of anybody reading it. I said, "Well'm, if he wants to, 
                    it's all right with me." She said, "Well, he says he'll make a trade with you. If
                    he don't have to read that book, he'll tell his publisher to take it." So I
                    said, "Done," <event desc="audience laughter"/>  And I finished the book, and he
                    told his publisher, Mr. Liveright, to take it, and that's how I got printed.
                        <event desc="audience laughter"/> But up to that time, I'd never thought of
                    being a professional writer because it was still fun. That's 
                    the first time I'd ever really connected money with—with writing a book. But
                    the—I think the—the pleasure in scribbling must have been
                    there all the time. I imagine that as soon as I learned to spell, I must have been trying to write
                    something, <inaudible/>. I don't remember what it could've been, but that's—that's a
                    curse that we're probably born with <inaudible/>.

                    up and uses it. Yes, sir, I've been influenced by that, by everything I've read.
                    Not deliberately. You just can't help it. That's a part of the—of the
