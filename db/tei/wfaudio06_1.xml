                    the narrative method that you adopt. Is it true to say that you adopt a lyrical
                    method to a narrative, and <unclear>a novel is also a</unclear> narrative of certain events and what the
                    characters do, what happens to them? We find that in a novel like <hi rend="italic">As I Lay Dying</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Sound and the
                        Fury</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Sanctuary</hi> that it's difficult to
                    follow the event. Is it true to say that you follow the lyrical method while
                    trying to tell a story? Am I correct?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, I think the writer is concerned first in telling about people,
                    people in conflict with themselves and with others, with their environment, and
                    he uses whatever method seems to him the best to tell what he is trying to tell
                    in the most dramatic and passionate way, that he is not trying to use a lyrical
                    method deliberately. It may seem to him best to use a lyrical method or maybe
                    the result of—of his own agony and anguish to say what he wants to say
                    becomes lyrical.</u></div2>

                    son and got too many, got so many that they destroyed him. It's incidentally the
                    story of—of Quentin Compson's hatred of the—the bad
                    qualities in the country he loves. But the central character is Sutpen, the

                    Coldfield was a—a petty, grasping man and Sutpen was a—a
                    bold, ruthless man, and Sutpen used Coldfield's pettiness for his, Sutpen's,
                    ends, but I don't remember exactly what it was.</u></div2>

                    made really clear that he is. Was he supposed to be part Negro, or was this
                    supposed to add to the tragic irony of the story?</u>
                <u who="WF">I think that was his tragedy. He didn't know what he was, and so he was
                    nothing. He—he deliberately evicted himself from the human race
                    because he didn't know which he was. That was his tragedy. That to me was the—the 
                    tragic, central idea of the story, that he didn't know what he was, and
                    there was no way possible in life for him to find out, which to me is the most
                    tragic condition a man could find himself in, not to know what he is

                    wasn't enough.  And then I tried Faulkner and that still wasn't enough. <event desc="audience laughter"/> It
