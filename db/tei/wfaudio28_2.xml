                <u who="WF">I would say that the quarrel was, in the beginning, economic, that in my
                    country anyway, the South, I mean
                    Mississippi, where the agrarian economy was based on the necessity for the
                    cheapest sort of labor, that the—the white man didn't want to lose his
                    Negro peon, really. He dressed it up in all sorts of emotional conditions
                    because the—the poor white man, who was in actual economic conflict
                    with the Negro for the same crop on the same sort of poor land, could respond
                    to that. The white man would see the Negro with—with the same poor
                    land as he, but—and with worse tools, with worse stock, yet would seem
                    to be happier, to make a better living for his family. All that white man had to
                    justify himself was that he was white, so he was better than the Negro, so
                    he—then he wouldn't have to say, "I—I'm a worse farmer than
                    he is." <unclear>He'd</unclear> say, "That don't matter. I'm better than he is
                    because I'm white." I think that had a great deal to do with it in my country.
                    Apart from that notion of mine that, because of our mutual past the white man
                    and—and the black man simply don't like each other and can't trust
                    each other.  Which is a condition—I don't know what to do about that. It would
                    take a psychiatrist or psychologist to eradicate that <unclear>one</unclear>.

                    reasons. He—he may have indigestion or he may have had
                    dealings with another white man that looked like him or had the same name, but
                    he will distrust the colored man at once because the colored man has black skin.

                    a colored man, but the only thing is that we are not able to show this
                    hostility, to come out at people, and we can find somebody on whom we can show
                    this hostility because he has a different color. I mean, it's something where

                <u who="WF">Yes, sir. People on the West Coast of this country distrust Japanese
                    because they're Japanese. There are other people that distrust Jewish people
                    because they're Jewish. But all white people seem, to me, to distrust Negroes.
                    Not white people on the West Coast to distrust Negroes, but all white people
                    seem to—to distrust Negroes, that they do not like Negroes.
                    It's—there's near as—as I can see without any geographical

                    in—in my part of the South where part of our culture has been that
                    agrarian economy in which the Negro was inferior because it was necessary that
                    he be either a slave or a peon. It seems to me that in this country, once the
                    Negro was freed of that—the—his condition in that agrarian
                    economy, then the culture, his culture, and the white man's culture don't touch

                    not changed it in the long run. In the long run, it was bound to come. The
                    Supreme Court had to make that decision. I would say that within five hundred
                    years the—the Negro race in this country will have disappeared. It
                    will be fifty years before Negroes are permitted in white schools in

                    last twelve months, there were thirty six hundred Negroes left for the North.
                    Out of that there will be—usually, ten percent will stay for a year or

                    writer write? Is it just to depict people in action or what they're doing? Why
                    would you be motivated to write if you don't particularly have a point to prove
                    or a sermon to preach? Is it just to put down what you observe and <unclear>see

                <u who="WF">Yes. First, you are demon driven. You can't help it. Also, it's fun.
                    It's the one occupation you have found which is fun because you're never bored
                    by it, because you can't do it. There's no such thing as satiety. You never can
                    write the book which you want to write. It will never quite match that dream, so
                    you always have something to get up tomorrow to do. In the last analysis, as I
                    said a while ago, you know that you're here for a specific time, which is
                    comparatively very short, that someday you'll pass through the wall into what
                    you don't know, and you will have left on that wall simply, "Kilroy was here."
                    It's not especially for—for glory nor fame, but to just leave a
                    scratch on it. It's that it was me that made that scratch. It wasn't anybody
