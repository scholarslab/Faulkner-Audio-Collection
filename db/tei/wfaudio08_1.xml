						Dr. <unclear>Whitten</unclear>. It might have been said at one time that Mr. Faulkner's
						works were known wherever the language was known. Today it has gone—gone far
						beyond, and wherever people read, his work is highly esteemed. It might be
						said fairly that he is the most distinguished writer in the world. At the
						University of Virginia we've been proud of his presence and pleased with the
						response. It is a great privilege to come over and bring Mr. Faulkner this
						afternoon. He will read from his short story "Shingles for the Lord," and

						<writing type="fiction">Pap got up a good hour before daylight and caught
							the mule and rid down to Killegrews' to borrow the froe and maul. He
							ought to been back with it in forty minutes. But the sun had rose and I
							had done milked and fed and was eating my breakfast when he got back,
							with the mule not only in a lather but right on the edge of the thumps
							too.<lb/>
							"Fox hunting," he said. "Fox hunting. A seventy-year-old man, with
							both feet and one knee, too, already in the grave, squatting all night
							on a hill and calling hisself listening to a fox race that he couldn't
							even hear unless they had come up onto the same log he was setting on
							and bayed into his ear trumpet. Give me my breakfast," he told maw.
							"Whitfield is standing there right this minute, straddle of that board
							tree with his watch in his hand."<lb/>
							And he was. We rid on past the church,
							and there was not only Solon Quick's school-bus truck but Reverend
							Whitfield's old mare too. We tied the mule to a sapling and hung our
							dinner bucket on a limb, and with pap toting Killegrew's froe and maul
							and the wedges and me toting our ax, we went on to the board tree where
							Solon and Homer Bookwright, with their froes and mauls and axes and
							wedges, was setting on two upended cuts, and Whitfield was standing jest
							like pap said, in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants and
							necktie, holding his watch in his hand. It was gold and in the morning
							sunlight it looked big as a full-growed squash. </writing>

					<u who="WF">
						<writing type="fiction">"You're late," he said.<lb/>
							So pap told him again about how
							Old Man Killegrew had been off fox hunting all night, and nobody at home
							to lend him the froe but Mrs. Killegrew and the cook. And naturally, the
							cook wasn't going to lend none of Killegrew's tools out, and Mrs.
							Killegrew was worser than deaf than even Killegrew. If you was to run in and
							tell her the house was afire, she would jest keep on rocking and say she
							thought so, too, <event desc="audience laughter"/> unless she began to holler back to the cook to turn the
							dogs loose before you could even open your mouth. <lb/>
							"You could have gone
							yesterday and borrowed the froe," Whitfield said. "You have known for a
							month now that you had promised this one day out of a whole summer
							toward putting a roof on the house of God."<lb/>
							"We ain't but two hours
							late," pap said. "I reckon the Lord will forgive it. He ain't interested
							in time, nohow. He's interested in salvation."<lb/>
							Whitfield never even
							waited for pap to finish. It looked to me like he even got taller,
							thundering down at pap like a cloudburst. "He ain't interested in
							neither! Why should He be, when He owns them both? And why He should
							turn around for the poor, mizzling souls of men that can't even borrow
							tools in time to replace the shingles on His church, I don't know
							either. Maybe it's just because He made them. Maybe He just said to
							Himself: 'I made them; I don't know why. But since I did, I Godfrey,
							I'll roll my sleeves up and drag them into glory whether they will or
							no!'" <event desc="audience laughter"/>

						<writing type="fiction">But that wasn't here nor there neither now, and I
							reckon he knowed it, jest like he knowed there wasn't going to be
							nothing atall here as long as he stayed. So he put the watch back into
							his pocket and motioned Solon and Homer up, and we all taken off our
							hats except him while he stood there with his face raised into the sun
							and his eyes shut and his eyebrows looking like a big iron-gray
							caterpillar laid along the edge of a cliff. "Lord," he said, "make them
							good straight shingles to lay smooth, and let them split out easy;
							they're for You," and opened his eyes and looked at us again, mostly at
							pap, and went and untied his mare and clumb up slow and stiff, like old

					<u who="WF">
						<writing type="fiction">Pap put down the froe and maul and laid the three
							wedges in a neat row on the ground and taken up the ax. <lb/>
							"Well, men," he
							said, "let's get started. We're already late."<lb/>
							"Me and Homer ain't,"
							Solon said. "We was here." This time him and Homer didn't set on the
							cuts. They squatted on their heels. Then I seen that Homer was whittling
							on a stick. I hadn't noticed it before. "I make it two hours and a
							little over," Solon said. "More or less."<lb/>
							Pap was still about half
							stooped over, holding the ax. "It's nigher one," he said. "But call it
							two for the sake of the argument. What about it?"<lb/>"What argument?" Homer
							said.<lb/> "All right," pap said. "Two hours then. What about it?"<lb/>
							"Which is
							three man-hour units a hour, multiplied by two hours," Solon said. "Or a
							total of six work units." When the WP and A first come to Yoknapatawpha
							County and started to giving out jobs and grub and mattresses, Solon
							went in to Jefferson to get on it. He would drive his school-bus truck
							the twenty-two miles in to town every morning and come back that night.
							He done that for almost a week before he found out he would not only
							have to sign his farm off into somebody else's name, he couldn't even
							own and run the school bus that he had built himself. So he come back
							that night and never went back no more, and since then hadn't nobody
							better mention WPandA to him unless they aimed to fight, too,  <event desc="audience laughter"/> though every
							now and then he would turn up with something all figured down into work
							units like he done now. "Six units short." </writing>

					<u who="WF">
						<writing type="fiction">"Four of which you and Homer could have already
							worked out while you was setting here waiting on me," pap said.<lb/>
							"Except
							that we didn't," Solon said. "We promised Whitfield two units of twelve
							three-unit hours toward getting some new shingles on the church roof. We
							been here ever since sunup, waiting for the third unit to show up, so we
							could get started. You don't seem to kept up with these modern ideas about
							work that's been flooding and uplifting the country in the last few
							years."<lb/>
							"What modren ideas?" pap said. "I didn't know there was but one
							idea about work—until it is done, it ain't done, and when it is done, it
							is." <event desc="audience laughter"/><lb/>
							Homer made another long, steady
							whittle on the stick. His knife was sharp as a razor. Solon taken out
							his snuffbox and filled the top and tilted the snuff into his lip and
							offered the box to Homer, and Homer shaken his head, and Solon put the
							top back on the box and put the box back into his pocket.<lb/>
							"So," pap
							said, "jest because I had to wait two hours for a old seventy-year man
							to get back from fox hunting that never had no more business setting out
							in the woods all night than he would 'a' had setting all night in a
							highway juke joint, we all three got to come back tomorrow to
							finish them two hours that you and Homer — "<lb/> "I ain't," Solon said. "I
							don't know about Homer. I promised Whitfield one day. I was here at

							the next day making up for the two hours of the day before that you and
							Homer never even worked."  <event desc="audience laughter"/><lb/>
							"It's going to more than jest break into a

							over. Six one-man-hour units. Maybe you can work twice as fast as me and

					<u who="WF">
						<writing type="fiction">"Maybe there's something else besides cash you might
							be able to trade with, though" Solon said. "You might use that dog."
							That was when pap actually stopped. I didn't know it myself then either,
							but I found it out a good long time before Solon did. Pap set there with
							the maul up over his head and the blade of the froe set against the
							block for the next lick, looking at Solon. "The dog?" he said.<lb/>
							It was
							a kind of mixed hound, with a little bird dog and some collie and maybe
							a considerable of almost anything else, but it would ease through the
							woods without no more noise than a hant and pick up a squirrel's trail
							on the ground and bark jest once, unless it knowed you was where you
							couldn't see it, and then tiptoe that trail out jest like a man and never
							make another sound until it treed, and only then when it knowed you
							hadn't kept in sight of it. It belonged to pap and Vernon Tull together.
							Will Varner give it to Tull as a puppy, and pap raised it for a half
							interest; me and him trained it and it slept in my bed with me until it
							got so big maw finally run it out of the house,  <event desc="audience laughter"/> and for the last six
							months Solon had been trying to buy it. Him and Tull had agreed on two
							dollars for Tull's half of it, but Solon and pap was still six dollars
							apart on ourn, because pap said it was worth ten dollars of anybody's
							money and if Tull wasn't going to collect his full half of that, he was
							going to collect it for him. </writing>

					<u who="WF">
						<writing type="fiction">"So that's it," pap said. "Them things wasn't work
							units atall. They was dog units." <event desc="audience laughter"/><lb/>
							
							"Jest a suggestion," Solon said. "Jest a friendly offer to keep them
							runaway shingles from breaking up your private business for six hours
							tomorrow morning. You sell me your half of that trick overgrown fyce and
							I'll finish these shingles for you."<lb/>
							"Naturally including them extra—six extra
							units of one dollars," pap said.<lb/>
							"No, no," Solon said. "I'll pay you the
							same two dollars for your half of that dog that me and Tull agreed on
							for his half of it. You meet me here tomorrow morning with the dog and
							you can go back home or wherever them urgent private affairs are
							located, and forget about that church roof." </writing>

						<writing type="fiction">"Your half of the dog for that half a day's work you
							still owe on them shingles."<lb/>
							"And the two dollars," pap said. "That you
							and Tull agreed on. I sell you half the dog for two dollars, and you
							come back here tomorrow and finish the shingles. You give me the two
							dollars now, and I'll meet you here in the morning with the dog, and you
							can show me the receipt from Tull for his half then."<lb/>
							"Me and Tull have
							done already agreed," Solon said.<lb/>
							"All right," pap said. "Then you can
							pay Tull his two dollars and bring his receipt with you without no
							trouble."<lb/>
							"Tull will be at the church tomorrow morning, pulling off them
							old shingles," Solon said. "All right," pap said. "Then it won't be no
							trouble at all for you to get a receipt from him. You can stop at the
							church when you pass. Tull ain't named Grier. He won't need to be off
							somewhere tomorrow borrowing a crowbar."<lb/>
							So Solon taken out his purse
							and paid pap the two dollars and they went back to work. And now it
							looked like they was really trying to finish that afternoon, not jest
							Solon, but even Homer, that didn't seem to be concerned in it nohow, and
							pap, that had already swapped a half a dog to get rid of whatever work
							Solon claimed would be left over. I quit trying to stay up with them

							"That's a fact," Solon said. "And since I am giving a
							day and a half to the church instead of jest a day, like I started out
							doing, I reckon I better get on home and tend to a little of my own

						<writing type="fiction"> "Sholy," Solon said. It sounded like he had forgot

							there again and looked hard and quiet at pap for about a second. "And a
							bill of sale from Tull for his half of it. As you say, it won't be no
							trouble a-tall to get that from him." Him and Homer got into the truck
							and he started the engine. You couldn't say jest what it was. It was
							almost like Solon was hurrying himself, so pap wouldn't have to make any
							excuse or pretense toward doing or not doing anything. "I have always
							understood the fact that lightning don't have to hit twice is one of the
							reasons why they named it lightning. So getting lightning-struck is a
							mistake that might happen to any man. The mistake I seem to have made is, I
							never realized in time that what I was looking at was a cloud. I'll see
							you in the morning."<lb/>"With the dog," pap said.<lb/>

							and Snopes was unloading a ladder from Snopes' wagon when we passed the
							church on the way home before dark, so all we had to do was to set the
							ladder up against the church. Then pap clumb up onto the roof with the
							lantern and pulled off shingles until he could hang the lantern inside
							behind the decking, where it could shine out through the cracks in the
							planks, but you couldn't see it unless you was passing in the road, and
							by that time anybody would 'a' already heard us. Then I clumb up with
							the rope, and pap reached it through the decking and around a rafter and
							back and tied the ends around our waists, and we started. And we went at
							it. We had them old shingles jest raining down, me using the claw hammer
							and pap using the crowbar, working the bar under a whole patch of
							shingles at one time and then laying back on the bar like in one more
							lick or if the crowbar ever happened for one second to get a solid holt,
							he would tilt that whole roof up at one time like a hinged box lid.<lb/>
							
							That's exactly what he finally done, he laid back on the bar and this
							time it got a holt. It wasn't jest a patch of shingles, it was a whole
							section of decking, so that when he lunged back he snatched that whole
							section of roof from around the lantern like you would shuck a corn
							nubbin. The lantern was hanging on a nail. He never even moved the nail,
							he jest pulled the board off of it, <event desc="audience laughter"/> so that it looked like for a whole
							minute I watched the lantern, and the crowbar, too, setting there in the
							empty air in a little mess of floating shingles, with the empty nail
							still sticking through the bail of the lantern, before the whole thing
							started down into the church. It hit the floor and bounced once. Then it
