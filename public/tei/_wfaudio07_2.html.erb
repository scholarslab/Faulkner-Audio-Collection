<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span> and the long sentence is an attempt to get his past and possibly
                    his future into the instant in which he does something. But to me, what he does
                    is&mdash;is not quite as important as who he is, the fact that he is a
                    continuity, that he has come a long way, that he has endured and he is, I hope,
                    we hope, better than&mdash;than his ancestors were, that he's more
                    compassionate. He's more tolerant. We hope braver, more honest.

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Mr. Faulkner, a few weeks ago the Richmond papers quoted you as having
                    organized <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[in ascending order of excellence]</span>  <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[American]</span> writers
                        <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[you admire]</span>. Would you be willing to suggest what the
                    criterion was, ?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>The criterion was failure. My feeling is that we all fail, that none of
                    it is as good as we all wanted it to be. None of my stuff is as good as I wanted
                    it to be. That's why I keep on writing another one, and so I
                       rated these people only by what I called the splendor of
                    the failure. The one that made the most magnificent failure I rated first,
                        <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> not by the&mdash;the value
                        that they did but by the splendor of the failure,
                    the&mdash;the ambition, the aspiration to do more than&mdash;than maybe
                    a human being can do, because you don't want to be better than&mdash;than
                    your&mdash;your fellow writer. You want to be as good as anybody that ever
                    did write. You want to be as good as <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Dante]</span> and Homer and Shakespeare and you can't,
                    you fail, so you write another book. If you ever did that one time, then there'd
                    be nothing left for you to do. You'd have to pick up&mdash;take up a new
                        trade.

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Mr. Faulkner, I once read an article in which the writer speaking of the
                    end of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, said that the whole
                    pattern of the book does not become apparent until the very end, in the incident
                    in which Benjy begins to cry and blubber when they go left around the monument
                    and must turn to the right. Now, while I think that simply confirms everything
                    that has gone before, did you intend that as the moment of revelation?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>No, sir, I did not. I was still&mdash;as I've just said, I was still
                    trying to tell that story. In the first section, I hadn't told it. I had to try
                    again. I had to try three, four times.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>I've always been afraid it was something I missed in the ending. I'm glad
                    to have you confirm that. <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[Thank you.]</span><span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>

                    way?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, sir, that's a&mdash;a matter of&mdash;of so much&mdash;as much of
                    that as possible is done up here. I have&mdash;have written three
                    manuscripts that never did quite please me, and I burned them up. But
                    it's&mdash;you try, and you try, and you try to do the best you can, to make
                    something which&mdash;which to you was&mdash;was passionate and moving,
                    so passionate and moving that it wouldn't let you alone. You had to write it.
                    And then you&mdash;you do the best you can to make it as passionate and
                    moving to anyone who reads it as it was to you, because it seems worthwhile,
                    worth doing.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Why do you suppose that it didn't work out in those three books?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>It could be that I didn't know enough. It could be that the people were

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>You once disinherited <em>Sanctuary</em> in the preface I
                    think to the Modern Library edition by saying it was a book written strictly for
                    money and that you hoped to make it as sensational as
                        possible If this is so, sir, why did you write a sequel
                    to it in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Well, I wrote that book to make a little money. I sent it to the
                    publisher, and he said, "Good, Lord, we all&mdash;we'll both be in jail if
                    we print this," <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span> so I forgot about it. I wrote
                    two more books. They were printed. And then one day I got the galleys for
                    <em>Sanctuary,</em> and I read them and it was so bad, so
                        basely conceived, that I wrote the publisher to let's
                    destroy it, and he said, "I have had the plates made. I have invested money in
                    it." At that time, he didn't have a great deal of money either, and I said,
                    "Well, it's&mdash;I can't pass it like this, so I'll rewrite it." And he said,
                    "All right, but you rewrite it then and&mdash;and I'll pay half the new plates, 
                    and you pay half the new plates," so I said "All right." So I rewrote the book and
                    made the best I could out of&mdash;out of the&mdash;the first base
                    story, and that cost me&mdash;my share of the plates was two hundred and
                    seventy dollars at a time when I didn't have two hundred and seventy dollars. I
                    got a job <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[passing]</span> coal at a power plant to earn my share. The book sold. The
                    first money I was to have, sixty-five hundred dollars, and the publisher went
                    broke, and I didn't get that, which served me exactly right. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span>

<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>When you wrote the <em>Fable</em> and moved over to a different

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>That was the only book I ever wrote from an idea, and the idea struck

                    had been crucified for the second time. We might not have but one more chance.
                    That came from an idea. That was the only book that was ever written from a
                    simple idea. The others have come from my own people.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>I mean that&mdash;that people want to be better than they are. I
                    believe that all people want to be better than they are, want to be more honest
                    and more compassionate. I think that's the only reason the human race
                    has&mdash;has lasted as long as it has, because it does want to be better
                    than it is, that individual people want to be better than they are afraid they
                    are, and they do try, and they fail, but then suddenly, when nobody expects it,
                    they are better.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Then may I ask if all of these characters in <em>The Sound

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>I would call them tragic people. The&mdash;the good people, Dilsey,
                    the Negro woman, she was a good human being. That she held that family together
                    for not the hope of reward, but just because it was the decent and proper thing

                    wants to be better than he is, that he doesn't want to be cruel, that he would

<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Sir, you indicated before that <em>A Fable</em> was a
                        departure in that&mdash;insofar that it was the only book written from a&mdash;an absolute
                        idea, with&mdash;with regular city limits to it. But I find&mdash;at least, I find,
                        that the&mdash;the basic crucifixion image in <em>A Fable</em> occurs over
                    and over again in your books. It occurs in <em>Light in
                        August</em>. It happens in a kind of way even in&mdash;in <em>Sanctuary. </em>It happens in <em>Requiem for a
                        Nun</em>, certainly, with&mdash;with Nancy. Isn't <em>A
                        Fable</em> simply a more positive way of approaching the problem?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>As a result, it might be. Remember, the writer must write out of his
                    background. He must write out of what he knows, and the Christian legend is a
                    part of&mdash;of any Christian's background, especially the background of
                    a&mdash;of a&mdash;of a country boy, a southern country boy. My life was
                    passed, my childhood, in a&mdash;a very small Mississippi town, and that was
                    a part of my background. I grew up with that. I assimilated that, took that in
                    without even knowing it. It's just&mdash;just there. It has nothing to do
                    with how much of it I might believe or disbelieve. It's just there.

                    and hunger and misery.  And in that way, man prevails. I&mdash;how far he can
                    go before through some of his own fault he eradicates himself from the face of
                    the earth, I don't know, but he tries to improve his condition and
                        does.

<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Mr. Faulkner, in reference to <em>The Sound and the

                    Jason?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>The title, of course, came from the first section, which was Benjy. I
                    thought that the story was told in Benjy's section, and the title came there. So
                    it&mdash;in that sense it does apply to Benjy rather than to anybody

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Though the&mdash;the more I had to work on the book,

<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>In <em>The Town</em>, there are references to episodes for

                    coherence to <em>The Town</em>?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span><em>The Town </em>is the second of a trilogy. The first
                    one was called <em>The Hamlet</em>. These references are to things

<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>But there&mdash;there are references to other books than <em>The Hamlet</em>

<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>I would like to ask if your people are derived principally from an area
                    or region of Mississippi, and if you think that was a way of life there that has
                    more to offer than, say, if a writer  perhaps to&mdash;the idea is that your surroundings

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>I don't think people are that different. I think there is not a great

                    Russians and Chinese. That I'm simply using the&mdash;the background, the
                    color, the&mdash;the smells, the&mdash;the sounds that I am familiar
                    with, but the people in my opinion are not that different. They could be
                    anywhere. Of course they would wear different clothes, and their behavior might
                    be a little awry from what it is in north Mississippi, but the behavior would be
                    the same. They would have the same anguishes, the same hopes, and
                    they&mdash;Russians or Chinese&mdash;would still want to be better than
                    they are afraid they might be, and they would <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[both]</span> try to be

<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Mr. Faulkner, you talk about your&mdash;so many of the things you
                    write about come from your background. A good part of my family is from

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Well, I don't know. There are not too many Mississippians read very much,

<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Now that I can't say, for the reason that the writer is really too
