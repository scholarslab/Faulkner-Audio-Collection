                    stepmother, who was also a young woman, who believed in the qualities which his
                    background, his tradition had taught him to believe a man should have to be
                    brave, to never brook an injury nor an insult. He had associated verbena with
                    her because she had said that was part of his awareness of her, that that was
                    the only flower she liked because that was one that smelled stronger than
                    courage and horses. She had assumed that after his father'd been killed, he
                    would take the pistols and go and—and kill his father's killer. He decided that
                    there'd been enough killing, but he couldn't run, so he went unarmed and faced
                    the man who had killed his father, and so he won the moral victory, which took
                    courage, too, and though his stepmother couldn't condone the fact that he had
                    not drawn blood for blood, an eye for an eye, she did realize that that took courage,
                    too, maybe more than to have gone armed.  And that was her way of
                    saying, "This is not my—my way of solving this, but what you did was
                    brave, too, and this is the way I'll say goodbye," so she left a sprig of
                    verbena where he could find it. That was—took the place of the note
                    she might have written him. She wasn't the sort to have written a
                        note.

                <u who="WF">That was because—that's something that I think I have seen in

                    clever, but the ones that are smart and clever have never had a chance to
                    because of the condition in which the white man wants to hold the Negro. This
                    one, he had freedom. He had the same background, environment that the white
                    boy had, and so he had a chance for what genius, what talent he had,
                    to—to flower without being challenged. That won't happen
                    with—with any Negro, just like it won't happen with any white boy, but
                    occasionally there would be the Negro, I think, with talent and capacity to be

                    would have had little patience with—with Ab Snopes. Ab Snopes hung
                    around the outskirts of the kill to get what scraps might be left. But nobody

                    the white people themselves?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, only that the white boy had told the nigger boy about trains, and
                    the nigger boy had never seen one, and he wanted to see one, too. It was just
                    unlucky that the time the Negro boy got to see the train it—it
                    couldn't have been running fast and fine and free. It was involved in war and
                    destruction at that time, that the Negro boy didn't get to see the splendid,
                    gallant train which white boy had seen in peacetime. I think there was no
                    significance to the fact that the Negro boy had to see a—a ruined
                    train, but only that he was unlucky in that he couldn't see that at a better
                    time, but the fact that—that he—that's his own cleverness to
                    cope with—with his condition, his environment, that even
                    a train that might not have been as fine and beautiful as the one the white boy
                    saw, but he had seen a train, too, and the Negro boy could probably
                    have imagined what that train would look like if it hadn't been in war. The
                    white boy might not have been able to.</u>

                    freedom, any—any tangible thing?</u>
                <u who="WF">No, that's the sort of symbolism which—which the reader must
                    bring to—to any—anything he reads. I mean must. He can't
                    help it. Because you—you read, just as you write, out of your own
                    experience of observation, imagination and actual seeing and hearing. You bring
                    that to what you read, and so the symbolism probably must be inherent in the
                    work, though the writer does not necessarily need to have said, "Now, I'm going
                    to put a little symbolism right here," because you write from the same thing you
                    read from, is the general fund of—of our record. I mean
                    by "our" all—all Americans, all the English-speaking people,
                        or we'll say all Christian people, read and write from
                    the same warehouse of—of experience, in the terms of culture.  So a 
                    reader, an erudite reader, can find more symbolism than an illiterate reader can
                    simply because the erudite bloke has read more. He has more to cast back to and
                    say, "Oh, yes, that's what this is." The—the—the illiterate
                    one would say, "Yes, this is true," but he sees no connection
                    with—with anything that somebody wrote 500 years ago or that
                    someone—some psychiatrist or psychologist has—has formulated
                    to explain behavior, which the erudite man knows. But the symbolism I'm sure are 
                    the—the—the symbols of the symbolism are inherent in the
                    work, if they came from the same culture as the reader and the writer.

                <u who="WF">Now, that is a question that probably no writer can answer for the
                    reason that the writer himself never knows just how much from which of the three
                    sources he has drawn to create his character. That is, the—the three
                    sources are observation, experience, and imagination. Of course, he's got to
                    write some of himself into—to whatever he writes, whether he wants to
                    or not. In a—a certain sense, anything anyone writes is biographical in that it
                    must come out of his own personal, private experience or imagination or
                    observation. I think that he lets his people speak in the—the terms,
                    in their own individual terms. He does not deliberately try to make them express
                    his own ideas unless he and they agree. You might say that—that any
                    writer is saying the writer is not responsible for any of the ideas these people

                    his own thoughts color what his characters see and do. It—I expect
                    it's impossible to keep them completely pure, or they would lack
                    the—the breath of life, emotion, which makes you want to read what
                    they say and what they do. But the writer is certainly trying to—to
                    submerge, relinquish himself completely into that character at the moment when

                    Unvanquished</hi> up until the time—I imagine—I think the two boys were
                    about twelve years old. You played up the fact that the white boy was one
                    little step ahead of the colored boy at that time by having seen something that
                    the other hadn't. Then afterwards, the colored boy took command of the situation
                    when they started their reselling of the mules, and I was wondering if you
                    thought that the colored person was coming into the <unclear>front</unclear>, or
                    into more power or initiative, in that day and age?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, I can't say. I think that—that anyone, regardless
                    of—of color—No, let me—let me start over again. I
                    would say that the color had nothing to do with how much any individual, any
                    human being can take advantage of—of his advantages. In this case,
                    that—that—the Negro boy was faster on his feet than the
                    white boy. That is because maybe the Negro boy had brought something from
                    Africa, when he had to be pretty quick on his feet in the rain forest to stay
                    alive. The white boy had a tradition of an aristocracy in which God had
                    protected him. He could afford to be a little slow, though if they were put in <inaudible/> 
                    <event desc="gap in tape"/> <unclear>for a 
                        second</unclear>, I don't think anyone could say that the Negro boy would've been faster
                    then than the white boy. Once the white boy realized that the old, secure
                    condition was gone, then he had to be pretty quick on his feet, too. Though my
                    thought is that—that everybody can't handle freedom if he had it, but
                    that anyone should have the chance, the freedom to see just how good he can be
                    and whether he's white or black. That he won't fail because he is black. That he
                    will fail because it was in—inherent in him not to cope with freedom.
                    He, whether he was white or black, had no business with
                        freedom.

                <u who="WF">They respond in different ways. The Snopes have responded to it and have
                    coped with it pretty well. I would say the one that is least troubled by change
                    was the sewing-machine agent Ratliff, that he had accepted a—a change
                    in culture, a change in environment, and he has suffered no anguish, no grief
                    from it. In—for that reason, he's in favor of change, because it's
                    motion, and it's the world as he knows it, and he's—he's never one to
                    say, "I—I wish I had been born a hundred years ago," or "I'm sorry I was born now
                    and couldn't have put it off a hundred years." Ratliff will take what's now and
                    do the best he can with it because he is—possesses what you might call
                    a—a moral, spiritual eupepsia, that his digestion is good, all right,
                    nothing alarms him.</u></div2>

                    moves along with it is apt to be the most successful or—?</u>
                <u who="WF">Well, he—he might have more peace. He may not be more
                    successful. By a man in motion, I meant simply that motion is life,
                    that—that man, if he's alive, he is in motion, and whether you like
                    where he's going or not, your only alternative is stasis or death, and the
                    choice which Ratliff had no trouble making is, "Either—either I will take this or
                    nothing, and I would prefer this to nothing, that I'd prefer breathing to not
                    breathing." But success—it would depend on what anyone means by
                    success. Maybe Ratliff never used that term to himself at all, but probably he
                    was, in own lights, quite successful. That is, he wanted— <event desc="end of recording"/></u></div2>
