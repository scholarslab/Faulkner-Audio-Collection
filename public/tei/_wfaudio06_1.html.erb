  <p><strong>Frederick Gwynn:</strong> questions having to do with his own work and on anything that 
                        people want to consider about the problems of writing in general.  It would help everybody in the room, 
                        I think, if each questioner spoke up not only for Mr. Faulkner&#x2019;s hearing but for everyone else&#x2019;s.  Mr. Faulkner. </p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.2">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, I come from India, and I've been trying to read a good many of your
                    books. The problem <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[I am finding]</span> it extremely difficult to follow
                    the narrative method that you adopt. Is it true to say that you adopt a lyrical
                    method to a narrative, and <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[a novel is also a]</span> narrative of certain events and what the
                    characters do, what happens to them? We find that in a novel like <em>As I Lay Dying</em> or <em>The Sound and the
                        Fury</em> or the <em>Sanctuary</em> that it's difficult to
                    follow the event. Is it true to say that you follow the lyrical method while
                    trying to tell a story? Am I correct?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, I think the writer is concerned first in telling about people,
                    people in conflict with themselves and with others, with their environment, and
                    he uses whatever method seems to him the best to tell what he is trying to tell
                    in the most dramatic and passionate way, that he is not trying to use a lyrical
                    method deliberately. It may seem to him best to use a lyrical method or maybe
                    the result of&#x2014;of his own agony and anguish to say what he wants to say
                    becomes lyrical.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.3">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, ma'am.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Who is the central character of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>?
                    It seems so obviously to be Sutpen, yet it's been said that it's also the story
                    of Quentin, and I was wondering just who is the central character?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>The central character is Sutpen, yes. The story of a man who wanted a
                    son and got too many, got so many that they destroyed him. It's incidentally the
                    story of&#x2014;of Quentin Compson's hatred of the&#x2014;the bad
                    qualities in the country he loves. But the central character is Sutpen, the
                    story of a man who wanted sons.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.4">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, in the same book, I was wondering what is supposed to be the
                    reader's attitude towards Mr. Coldfield, the father of Ellen?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, my attitude is that he was a&#x2014;a pretty poor man. I don't
                    know what the reader's attitude might be, but I still felt compassion and pity
                    for him, but he was a poor man in my opinion.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.5">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, what sort of a deal was made between Goodhue Coldfield and Sutpen in
                        reference to the bill of lading? It looked like they pulled some sort of
                    deal.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I don't remember. That book is so long ago to me, but&#x2014;but
                    Coldfield was a&#x2014;a petty, grasping man and Sutpen was a&#x2014;a
                    bold, ruthless man, and Sutpen used Coldfield's pettiness for his, Sutpen's,
                    ends, but I don't remember exactly what it was.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.6">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner&#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, in <em>Light in August</em>, the central character Joe
                    Christmas had most of his troubles and his persecutions and in his search to
                    find himself was based on his belief that he was part Negro, and yet it's never
                    made really clear that he is. Was he supposed to be part Negro, or was this
                    supposed to add to the tragic irony of the story?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I think that was his tragedy. He didn't know what he was, and so he was
                    nothing. He&#x2014;he deliberately evicted himself from the human race
                    because he didn't know which he was. That was his tragedy. That to me was the&#x2014;the 
                    tragic, central idea of the story, that he didn't know what he was, and
                    there was no way possible in life for him to find out, which to me is the most
                    tragic condition a man could find himself in, not to know what he is
                    and to know that he will never know.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.7">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, if&#x2014;if he is not&#x2014;does not definitely have Negro blood, well,
                    what is the significance of Gavin Stevens's surmise there at the end when he
                    explains that there's a conflict of blood? That that is only a guess that stands
                    for a guess and not a final knowledge of &#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, yes, that is&#x2014;is an assumption, a rationalization which Stevens
                    made. That is, the people that destroyed him made rationalizations about what he
                    was. They decided what he was. But Christmas himself didn't know, and he evicted
                    himself from mankind.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.8">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Frederick Gwynn:</strong>Sir, when in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, after the killing
                        of Charles Bon, Clytie tries to keep Rosa Coldfield from&#x2014;from coming in, does Clytie
                    realize that Charles Bon is her own half-brother? Is that the reason that she's
                    trying to keep Rosa out, do you think? Does she feel any relationship?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I don't remember. I don't remember that. Let me think a minute.
                    I&#x2014;I don't remember whether Clytie was any relation to Charles Bon's
                    mother. That's so long ago, too.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>They have the same father.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, then, yes, that would be the reason, of course.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.9">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Joseph Blotner:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, do you think that a comparison can justly be made between
                    Joe Christmas and Charles Bon's son? Is there much in their behavior you think
                    that's similar?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>There again you have me. I don't remember. They're both so long ago, and
                    that's one good thing about being a writer. You can get rid of one book you
                    don't have to read again. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.10">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>John Coleman:</strong>Mr. Faulkner &#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>John Coleman:</strong>In working out the situation of Joe Christmas, did you deliberately have
                    in mind a correspondence between his situation and Oedipus, for example, as has
                    recently been brought out in an essay published in the <em>Quarterly</em> magazine?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, not deliberately and not consciously. That's another matter of the
                    writer reaching back into the lumber room of his memory for whatever he needs
                    to&#x2014;to create the character or the situation. The&#x2014;and
                    the&#x2014;the similarity is there, but it was not by deliberate intent. It
                    was by&#x2014;by coincidence, not accident, but by coincidence.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.11">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Along those same lines, I noticed a similarity between Sutpen and
                    Heathcliff from Emily Bronte's <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, and I
                    was wondering if there's any intentional similarities here at all?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I don't know. I don't know <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I
                    never read it.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Thank you.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.12">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, in <em>Wild Palms</em>, there is a passage
                    strongly reminiscent of the Grand Inquisitor in Dostoevsky's <em>Brothers 
                        Karamazov,</em> the import of which seems to condemn not Christ
                    but organized religion. In <em>Light in August,</em> much of the
                    action seems to stem from almost fanatical Calvinism. Would it be true to
                    surmise that you favor strongly individual rather than an organized
                    religion?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I do, always.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Then you think perhaps that man must work out his own salvation from
                    within rather than without?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I do, yes.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.13">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, I have often wondered through what process the author actually goes
                    when he writes a book. Could you briefly outline what process you go through?
                        <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Now, I know I can't. I'm&#x2014;I'm lazy. I hate to&#x2014;the
                    mechanics of putting the words down on paper, and I do as much of it as possible
                    in my head. I will&#x2014;that is, putting it down on paper is the last
                    resort. I've got to get it out of my system, and so I don't know what system I
                    might use mentally to get the&#x2014;the facts in order, to&#x2014;to
                    bring the&#x2014;the mass of material into the&#x2014;the&#x2014;the form according
                    to the rules of&#x2014;of unity and emphasis. I&#x2014;I just don't know.
                    Some people work from notes. They&#x2014;they make notes and then correlate
                    the notes and then edit and then write and then do a&#x2014;a draft. I don't
                    do that. I try my best not to have to change anything because I'm lazy, I think,
                    that I don't like to work.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.14">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>How many times do you rewrite the 
                    <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[hundreds of]</span> drafts?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Sometimes the first one is all right. Sometimes I will do three or four
                    or five until it comes right, but I will try my best not to do it but once
                    because I hate to work. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.15">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, ma'am.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>In another class, you stated that you seldom have the plot of your novels
                    worked about before you begin to write, but that they simply develop from
                    a&#x2014;from a character or an incident. I was wondering if you remember
                    what character or what incident caused you to write <em>Absalom,
                        Absalom!</em>?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Sutpen.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>You thought about the character &#x2014;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, the&#x2014;the idea of a man who&#x2014;who wanted sons and
                    got sons who destroyed him. The&#x2014;the other characters I had to get out
                    of the attic to tell the story of Sutpen.</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.16">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Mr. Faulkner, do you ever consciously base your&#x2014;any of your
                    characters, either major characters or minor characters, on people you find in
                    every-day life. For example, during your time spent in Charlottesville, could
                    you possibly incorporate someone who lived here into one of your major books, as
                    a conscious exercise?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>I will very likely do it, but not as a conscious exercise. The writer is
                    completely amoral. He&#x2014;he will use experience. He will rob from other
                    writers. He will take from life, but he is&#x2014;is trying to create a
                    character of his own, and so very likely in time, I will&#x2014;will need
                    someone I have seen in Charlottesville, Virginia, and will without any
                    compunction use him. <span class="event tooltip" title="There was some audience laughter happening">[audience laughter]</span></p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.17">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>I've been looking for Sutpen's&#x2014;the reason for Sutpen's
                    downfall, Mr. Faulkner, and it seems to me that the Civil War plays a part in
                        it. Is that&#x2014;is that true?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>But that's not&#x2014;that's not the main reason?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, this&#x2014;I used the Civil War to&#x2014;for my own ends
                    there. Sutpen&#x2014;Sutpen's country was wrecked by the Civil
                    War, but that didn't stop Sutpen. He was still trying to get the son, still
                    trying to establish a dynasty. He was still trying to get even with that man who
                    in his youth had said, "Go to the back door."</p>
  <hr/>
  <a name="wfaudio06_1.18">&#xA0;</a>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Yes, sir.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>Unidentified participant:</strong>Sir, in <em>Light in August,</em> much of the action comes
                    back to the scene or the picture of a column of yellow smoke coming up from
                    Joanna Burden's cabin. I was wondering&#x2014;you had said that in <em>Sound and the Fury</em> you got the idea for the story
                    from seeing a little girl like Caddy in a tree. I was wondering if that happened
                    with <em>Light in August</em>. Perhaps that was the scene that you
                    had seen and that you started from in that story.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, that story began with Lena Grove, the idea of&#x2014;of&#x2014;of the young
                    girl with nothing, pregnant, determined to find her sweetheart. It
                    was&#x2014;that was out of my&#x2014;my admiration for women, for the
                    courage and endurance of women. As I told that story, I had to get more and more
                    into it, but that was mainly the story of Lena Grove.</p>

                    brought the children there to watch it? Was that another example of the
                    decadence of the South?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>No, not&#x2014;not by intent. That was&#x2014;was another instance
                    of Sutpen's ruthlessness, of his will, his implacable will to create a dynasty
                    and fill it with sons, and I&#x2014;I thought of&#x2014;of rather these,
                    which seemed to me dramatic or&#x2014;or amusing or tragic incidents, invented

                    his death? Is that to relate back to the social stratum from which Sutpen
                    himself came and have there a sort of ironic effect? Just what was the idea of
                    that?</p>
  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>In a sense. In another sense, Wash Jones represented the man
                    who survived the Civil War. The&#x2014;the aristocrat in the columned house
                    was ruined, but Wash Jones survived it unchanged. He had been Wash Jones before
                    1861, and after 1865 he was still Wash Jones, and Sutpen finally collided with

  <hr/>
  <p><strong>William Faulkner:</strong>Well, the&#x2014;the story was told by Quentin to Shreve. Shreve
                    was&#x2014;was the&#x2014;the comment&#x2014;the commentator that held
                    the thing to&#x2014;to something of reality. If Quentin had been let alone to
                    tell it, it would have&#x2014;have become completely unreal. It had to have
                    a&#x2014;a&#x2014;a solvent to keep it real, keep it believable, creditable.

                    wasn't passionate enough or pure enough, but I don't remember at what point I
                    put it down. Though when I took it up again I almost rewrote the whole thing. I
                    think that what I put down were inchoate fragments that wouldn't coalesce, and
                    then when I took it up again, I&#x2014;as I remember, I rewrote it.</p>

                    sentence toward the end of "The Bear." I am going to read part of the sentence
                    so that you will understand what I am asking about. "There was a boy who wished
                    to learn humility and pride in order to become skillful and worthy in the woods.
                    He suddenly found himself becoming so skillful so rapidly that he feared that he
                    would never become worthy because he had not learned humility." Then finally, it
                    goes on, "until an old man who could not have defined either had led
                    him as though by the hand to that point where an old bear and a little mongrel
                    of a dog showed him that by possessing one thing other he would possess them
                    both." What is that "one thing other"?</p>
