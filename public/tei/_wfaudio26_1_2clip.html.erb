<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>Did Quentin, before, actually have a conversation with his father about
                        sleeping with his sister? Or was that part of his ?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>He never did. He said, "If I were brave I would&mdash;I&mdash;I
                        might say this to my father, whether it was a lie or not." Or&mdash;or, "If
                        I were&mdash;if I would say this to my father, maybe he could answer me back
                        the magic word which would relieve me of this anguish and agony which I live
                        with." No, they were imaginary. He just said "Suppose I say this to my father.
                        Would it help me? Would it clarify? Would I see clearer
                        what it is that I anguish over?"</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Unidentified participant</span>The feeling between him and his sister is pretty strong, though,
                        <span class="unclear tooltip" title="Text was unclear">[isn't it]</span>?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">William Faulkner</span>Yes, yes. But in Caddy's opinion he was&mdash;was such a&mdash;a
                        weakling that even if they had been no kin, she would never had chosen him for
                        her sweetheart. She would have chosen one like the&mdash;the ex-soldier she
                        did, but never anybody like Quentin.</p>
