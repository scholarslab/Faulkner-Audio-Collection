                    <head>Introduction</head>
                    <u who="G">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Faulkner is generously with us once again. On
                    two levels, one that came up last week when a young Polish visitor to the United
                    States came up to the fifth floor of Cabell Hall with a translation, a Polish
                    translation, of Mr. Faulkner's <hi rend="italic">The Wild Palms</hi>. I suppose
                    it has some—emphasizes—or it was published because of the
                    theme of the difficulty of love in a capitalist society, but it shows
                    the—once again, the extent of Mr. Faulkner's current influence. On the
                    other hand, a colleague, Mr. Blotner, as a matter of fact,
                    reports that at the—during the comprehensives last week, an English
                    major—one boy identified the novel <hi rend="italic">The Town</hi> as
                    simply "novel, twentieth century, by our own Mr. William Faulkner." So we run
                    between these two extremes of local pride and international pride. And I think
                    that may set the tone for the kind of questions we are allowed to ask Mr.
                    Faulkner, i.e. anything. Mr. Faulkner.</u>

                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, in <hi rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio,</hi> Sherwood
                    Anderson has a section in there on Jesse Bentley that doesn't seem connected
                    with the rest of the book as much as the other chapters. That is, none of the
                    people in there knew George Willard. There's been criticism of this. Would you
                    care to comment on that <unclear>as it stands—maybe your fourth
                        section of "The Bear," seems to bear a relation on the past to the present
                        whereas</unclear>—is there much as much of a relationship in this
                    section of <hi rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</hi>?</u>
                <u who="WF">I'm sure there was in Mr. Anderson's concept of it. I think the writer
                    looks on his work as an entity, that it has got to—to please him by
                    its completeness, its wholeness. What seems extraneous to somebody else, to him
                    may seem completely necessary, that without that even though it might have
                    been—been out of—out of <unclear>tune almost,</unclear> was
                    necessary to the—the work as a whole, an entity. And I'm sure that Mr.
                    Anderson felt that his book without that was not finished, not complete. That it
                    wasn't intact.

                    <head>Cowley's Interpretation</head>
                    <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, Malcolm Cowley has written that not one of your characters
                        exercises the faculty of conscious choice between good
                    and evil, that they seem to be haunted, obsessed and driven—or driven
                    by some kind of destiny. Do you think that's a valid
                    statement?</u>
                <u who="WF">Yes, it is quite valid, in—in the sense that—that
                    anyone who reads a—a book or story gives something to
                    that—something of himself to that book or that story. It takes that.
                    The—the—the man that wrote it offers a <unclear>step</unclear>. That is, he
                    offers his own opinion, which is his own concept of a fundamental truth. Someone
                    else sees it, sees the same fundamental truth, but he adds something to it. If
                    the—the critic is—is intelligent, is sympathetic and is
                    quite honest, of course, his criticism, even though I might not agree with it,
                    is valid. And I think the writer's not the one to say that it's wrong simply
                    because he doesn't agree with it. Mr. Cowley may be right. I don't think he is,
                    but I'm not the one to say that he's wrong just because we don't agree. But at
                    least he brought enough attention and sympathy to the book to have a sound or
                    valid opinion of it, which is certainly what the critic should do. Not to write
                    what the critic's own clients expect to hear from him the next time he reviews a
                    book, but to give his concept of a piece of work, a work of art.

                    completely valid reasons if you accept his premise. It's like the—the

                    until you find out he thinks he's Gandhi. Darl could have had our reasons and
                    his own mad reasons for what he did. Could have had any number of reasons.
                    The—the—the sane reason might be to—to efface a <inaudible/>, but
                    his own reasons, we don't know what they might be because he was mad.

                    <u who="WF">Yes, sir.</u>
                <u who="Q">Mr. Faulkner, some of the prose writers in this so-called San Francisco
                    renaissance that's going on now feel that the novel form as a type is archaic
                    and that it won't make any progress until they can get rid of the discipline
                    imposed by simple grammar, punctuation, the language in general. I wonder how
                    you'd react to this idea <unclear>of theirs</unclear>.</u>
                <u who="WF">I think the—the manner, the method is—is not too
                    important. The writer is simply trying to arrest in one dramatic moment an
                    instant of man's struggle within the human dilemma. I think that he should use
                    whatever method seems the best to him to do that. But I don't think that because
                    he believes that—that his method is the best one that all other methods are
                    bad. And I think that if—if anyone is going to waste his time trying
                    to abolish the—the form of the novel, then he's not going to get much
                    good work done. To use whatever form is—comes to hand that does his
                    job. If it's a moving picture camera, use that. If he'd rather use paint,
                    use that. If he'd rather—if he thinks he can do it better with sign
                    language, assuming that he can communicate with enough readers, use that. I
                    imagine that any form is—is going to change, but I don't think
                    that—that we will see the time when folks will get rid of grammar and
                        punctuation.

                    his lusts, greeds, also his conscience, whatever it is that makes him want to be
                    better than he is and makes him, even when he's responsible for it, hate the
                    condition in which the weak suffer and anyone is hungry <unclear>which will
                        always occur</unclear>. That he would like to alter that. He hasn't been
                    able to so far, yet he doesn't quit trying. His dilemma is to—to
                    arrange the world in which he lives, in which he—and where he came
                    without any—any choice, into a condition in which he can get the most
                    for his money, you might say. His dilemma is his struggle with his own nature
                    against his conscience. Call that God or whatever you like. But whatever it is
                    that—that makes man want to be better than he is and that he is afraid
                    he may be able to be. That he wants to be braver than he is afraid he might be.
                    He wants to be more honest than he's afraid he might be able to be. And he
                    wants—wants peace. He wants happiness, what he calls happiness. And

                <u who="WF">Well, of course a part of—of man's dilemma, the individual
                    dilemma, is that man, individual man, is the victim of his past. Actually
                    there's—there's no such thing as "me," probably, that I am a
                    conglomeration of a lot of "us."  Probably a great deal of—of man's
                    behavior is from a pattern that was fixed long before he entered it. He
                    inherited it, that he can't help doing some of the thing he does. He can't help
                    his—his attitude toward that that he—he has. He—he
                    might be educated out of them. I think that the—the wise
                    person—I mean wise in the sense that Dilsey was wise, to do the best
                    she could with what she had, she would know by instinct that she
                    must—must abolish the past. That she must accept—accept
                    "now," and accept the—the moment in which "now" becomes "will be."

                    by blood, but they had begun to take white names by that time. When—as
                    they became plantation owners and held U.S. commissions.  But he

                    that he was pretty shrewd about that, that he just behaved in a naive and
                    innocent way, but he wasn't. That he had—had abolished the past and
                    had taught himself pretty fast to cope with "now," with environment.

                    There was only one more step left to him. He couldn't be alive and escape back
                    before when his sister was pure. And so he had to commit suicide. That was all
                    that remained for him. Dilsey accepted the past, and she didn't waste herself
                    trying to discard it or get away from it. She simply accepted it and said,
                    "All right. So it is. Let's go on. Let's go forward." That time was—was
                    in its perspective for, I think, the both of them, but—but one of them
                    hated "now" and wanted to return to "was," which you can't do because what was,
                    is. There's actually no such thing as "was." As we said any man is the victim
                    of—not only victim, but the sum of his past. He never escapes from it.
                    Quentin wanted to escape back into it.
